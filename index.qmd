This book, **Statistical Audit Sampling with R**, is intended as a practical
guide for auditors who wish to utilize state-of-the-art statistical methodology
in their audit sampling activities. While the focus of this book is exclusively
on audit sampling, it aims to examine the topic from both the classical
(frequentist) perspective and the Bayesian perspective. By examining the subject
through these two lenses, the book explains the statistical theory behind
commonly used audit sampling procedures and demonstrates how to perform these
procedures in accordance with international auditing standards, using the
**jfa** R package, in a statistically sound manner.
