This book, **Statistical Audit Sampling with R**, is intended as a practical
guide for auditors who wish to employ probability theory in their audit sampling
activities. While the focus of this book is exclusively on audit sampling, it
aims to examine the topic from both the classical (frequentist) perspective and
the Bayesian perspective. By examining the subject through these two lenses, the
book explains the statistical theory behind commonly used audit sampling
procedures and demonstrates how to perform these procedures in accordance with
international auditing standards, using the **jfa** R package, in a
statistically sound manner.
