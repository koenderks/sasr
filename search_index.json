This book focuses on two auditing procedures that are commonly performend in a statistical manner: audit sampling and data auditing. It explains the underlying statistical auditing theory from a classical and Bayesian point of view and demonstrates how to perform these procedures in a sound manner compliant with international auditing standards using the jfa R package. Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and a number of chapters are still missing.

"],["preface.html", "Preface", " Preface This book is for auditors who want to use statistical sampling. Even a scanning of it should convince many auditors that statistical sampling is as specialized an audit tool as the computer and also that it holds nearly as much promise for enhancing audit practice. Both statistical sampling and the computer require improved audit planning and a more thorough understanding of the objectives of audit tests. However, until now, there has not been an understandable and comprehensive explanation of statistical sampling in auditing comparable to material available on the computer. The book covers the array of statistical techniques available to the auditor thoroughly, yet understandably, and explains what they are, the assumptions on which they are based, and in what circumstances they should be used. Some statistical techniques—such as dollar unit sampling, discovery sampling, or difference estima­ tion—have been touted as ideally suited to the needs of auditors. This book makes clear that no sampling plan is superior in every situation. More important, it explains the considerations that should determine the auditor’s choice of a particular sampling plan The book provides practical ideas on incorporating statistical sampling into audit practice. Advice is given on establishing firm-wide policies, conducting training pro­ grams, and documenting and reviewing statistical applications. Often, valid applica­ tion of statistical sampling in auditing requires specialized knowledge that exceeds the practical knowledge and skills of a staff auditor; this book will increase recogni­ tion of that. However, it will also provide the basis for a CPA firm to develop and implement the specialization required for efficient and effective use of statistical sampling in its practice. Manual application of statistical sampling is often expensive, tedious, and time­ consuming—disadvantages that usually offset the expected advantages of statistical sampling. This book not only recognizes the importance of the computer to effective and efficient application of statistical sampling, but supplies useful computer pro­ grams as well. Finally, although some progress has been made in relating statistical tests to audit judgments, this book is more comprehensive in this area. Statistical tests often provide only part of the audit evidence for a particular account or class of transactions and never provide more than a portion of the evidence supporting an opinion on financial statements. This book offers many suggestions for integrating statistical tests with other audit tests and relating statistical judgments to other audit judgments. Auditors have long needed a practical and knowledgeable explanation of statis­ tical applications in auditing. Most discussions about statistics in auditing are either simplified introductions without enough detail to permit direct application or esoteric dissertations filled with statistical jargon and complex formulas This book is neither simplistic nor esoteric; it provides a systematic approach to audit planning that includes statistics as an important tool. The purpose of this book is to help the auditor use statistical sampling in audit practice. Statistical techniques currently being used in practice are discussed together with some suggestions concerning how and when each may be imple­ mented The major topic addressed is the integration of statistical sampling into the auditing process Although a brief review is provided, the reader is expected to be familiar with the basic concepts of statistical sampling. The exposition is directed to auditors who already know something about commonly used statistical techniques and want to incorporate them into an audit practice. The necessary background in statistical concepts may have been acquired in a variety of ways the programmed instruction series published by the AICPA, college coursework, or programs available through organizations such as the Institute of Internal Auditors, the state societies of CPAs, or one of the CPA firms However, those persons whose backgrounds consist of self-instruction would benefit from discussion with others who have had some experience in using statistical techniques in auditing. The first chapter discusses the audit process from the point of view of the auditor who wishes to limit audit risk and, thus, demonstrates the role of statistical sampling Chapters 2 through 6 summarize the basic statistical concepts and techniques that are currently used in statistical auditing Chapter 7 suggests procedures that might be used in integrating these techniques into the auditing process in order to limit the risk caused by observing only a sample Chapter 8 illustrates those procedures by means of an extended case study, and chapter 9 describes the set of computer programs that assist the auditor in planning, selecting, and evaluating statistical samples. Finally, the problems of training and implementation are discussed in chapter 10 "],["CHAPTER-R-BASICS.html", "Chapter 1 R Basics", " Chapter 1 R Basics This chapter covers the basics: installing and using packages and loading data. "],["installing-a-package.html", "1.1 Installing a Package", " 1.1 Installing a Package This book illustrates its concepts and ideas using the jfa package, which can be downloaded from CRAN. You can install this package by running the command below in R: install.packages(&quot;jfa&quot;) "],["loading-a-package.html", "1.2 Loading a Package", " 1.2 Loading a Package To load a package into your R session, call library() and provide the name of the package you want to load. Naturally, this requires that you already have the package installed on the computer. For example, before running the examples in this book, you can load the jfa package with: library(jfa) Note If you want a deeper understanding of how the jfa package works, or want to look at the source code of the package, see the package website. Packages in R are collections of functions and/or data that are bundled up for easy distribution, and installing a package will extend the functionality of R on your computer. If an R user creates a package and thinks that it might be useful for others, that user can distribute it through a package repository. The primary repository for distributing R packages is called CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network), but there are others, such as Bioconductor, which specializes in packages related to genomic data. If you have spent much time learning R, you may have heard of the tidyverse, which is a collection of R packages that share common ideas of how data should be structured and manipulated. This is in contrast to base R, which is the set of packages that are included when you just download and install R. The tidyverse is a set of add-ons for R, which make it easier to do many operations related to data manipulation and visualization. This book mostly uses the tidyverse, as I believe that it provides a quicker and simpler (but not less powerful!) way to work with data.

This function is significantly faster than read.csv(), and 1.4.3 Discussion Since data files have many different formats, there are many options for loading them. For example, if the data file does not have headers in the first row: data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datafile.csv&quot;, header = FALSE) The resulting data frame will have columns named V1, V2, and so on, and you will probably want to rename them manually: # Manually assign the header names names(data) &lt;- c(&quot;Column1&quot;, &quot;Column2&quot;, &quot;Column3&quot;) You can set the delimiter with sep. If it is space-delimited, use sep = \" \". If it is tab-delimited, use \\t, as in: data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datafile.csv&quot;, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) By default, strings in the data are treated as factors. Suppose this is your data file, and you read it in using read.csv(): &quot;First&quot;,&quot;Last&quot;,&quot;Sex&quot;,&quot;Number&quot; &quot;Currer&quot;,&quot;Bell&quot;,&quot;F&quot;,2 &quot;Dr.&quot;,&quot;Seuss&quot;,&quot;M&quot;,49 &quot;&quot;,&quot;Student&quot;,NA,21 The resulting data frame will store First and Last as factors, though it makes more sense in this case to treat them as strings (or character vectors in R terminology). To differentiate this, use stringsAsFactors = FALSE. If there are any columns that should be treated as factors, you can then convert them individually: data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datafile.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # Convert to factor data$Sex &lt;- factor(data$Sex) str(data) #&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 3 obs. of 4 variables: #&gt; $ First : chr &quot;Currer&quot; &quot;Dr.&quot; &quot;&quot; #&gt; $ Last : chr &quot;Bell&quot; &quot;Seuss&quot; &quot;Student&quot; #&gt; $ Sex : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;F&quot;,&quot;M&quot;: 1 2 NA #&gt; $ Number: int 2 49 21 Alternatively, you could load the file with strings as factors, and then convert individual columns from factors to characters. 1.4.4 See Also read.csv() is a convenience wrapper function around read.table().

If you don’t want to use that row for column names, use col_names = FALSE. The columns will instead be named X1, X2, and so on. By default, read_excel() will infer the type of each column, but if you want to specify the type of each column, you can use the col_types argument. You can also drop columns if you specify the type as \"blank\". # Drop the first column, and specify the types of the next three columns data &lt;- read_excel(&quot;datafile.xls&quot;, col_types = c(&quot;blank&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, &quot;numeric&quot;)) 1.5.4 See Also See ?read_excel for more options controlling the reading of these files. There are other packages for reading Excel files. The gdata package has a function read.xls() for reading in .xls files, and the xlsx package has a function read.xlsx() for reading in .xlsx files. They require external software to be installed on your computer: read.xls() requires Java, and read.xlsx() requires Perl.
