# Standard Workflow {#part-workflow}

The audit sampling workflow is an essential component of statistical audit
sampling with R. It involves a series of steps that help auditors select a
representative sample from a population of transactions or items, and then use
statistical analysis to draw conclusions about the entire population.

In this part of the book, we will delve into the details of the standard audit
sampling workflow and how it can be implemented using the powerful tools and
techniques available in R.

![The standard audit sampling workflow consists of four stages: planning, selection, execution and evaluation.](./img/workflow.png)

### Stage 1: Planning {.unnumbered}

Proper planning of a sample can lead to an increase in audit efficiency. Auditing
a small sample does not demand a great deal of audit effort, but it also does
not provide a high level of assurance. In contrast, auditing a larger sample
provides a higher level of assurance, but it also requires more audit effort.
Therefore, it is often advantageous to determine the sample size beforehand in
order to find the optimal balance between these two considerations. In Chapter
3, we will examine the various factors that should be taken into account when
planning an audit sample and how to use R to aid in the sample
planning process.

### Stage 2: Selection {.unnumbered}

Selecting a sample is the second step in the audit sampling workflow. In Chapter
4, we will explore the various approaches and techniques that can be used to
select an audit sample using R. We will also provide examples to help you
understand how to apply these techniques in real-world audit scenarios.

### Stage 3: Execution {.unnumbered}

The third stage of the audit sampling process is known as the execution stage.
During this stage, the auditor examines a selection of items from the population
and assesses their accuracy or fairness. This stage involves manual labor and
does not involve statistical inference.

### Stage 4: Evaluation {.unnumbered}

Evaluating an audit sample is a crucial stage in the audit sampling workflow. In
Chapter 5, we will examine the methods and techniques utilized to evaluate an
audit sample from a classical and Bayesian point of view. We will delve into the
diverse statistical tests and metrics that can be applied to estimate the
population misstatement and quantify the strenght of evidence for or against a
hypothesis provided by the sample data. By the end of this chapter, you will
possess a thorough comprehension of how to effectively and efficiently evaluate
an audit sample using R and make informed decisions based on the results.
Chapter 6 discusses how these methods can be generalized and applied when
evaluating stratified samples.
