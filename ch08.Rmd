# Other Software {#CHAPTER-8}

This chapter discusses other R-related open-source software implementing
statistical techniques for audit sampling.

## JASP for Audit (GUI)

JASP for Audit [@derks2021_jasp] is an add-on module for
[JASP](http://jasp-stats.org/) [@JASP], based on the **jfa** package, that
facilitates statistical audit sampling. Concretely, it contains graphical user
interfaces (GUI's) for calculating sample sizes, selecting items according to
standard audit sampling techniques, and performing inference about the
population misstatement on the basis of a data sample or summary statistics of a
sample. The module also features Bayesian equivalents of these analyses that
enable the user to easily incorporate prior information into the statistical
procedure. In all analyses, the Audit module offers explanatory text that helps
the auditor in interpreting, explaining, and reporting the analysis. Since JASP
for Audit is an R-based GUI around **jfa**, its functionality can be mapped
almost one-on-one to that of the package.

### Planning

Planning a sample in JASP for Audit works similar to how you would do it in
**jfa**. For example, the screenshot below shows how to plan a minimum sample
size for a performance materiality of 5% using a beta(1, 1) prior distribution,
while expecting zero misstatements in the sample.

In **jfa**, these results can be reproduced via the following command:

```{r}
planning(materiality = 0.05, likelihood = "binomial", prior = TRUE)
```


### Selection

### Evaluation

Evaluating a sample in JASP for Audit works similar to how you would do it in
**jfa**. For example, the screenshot below shows how to evaluating a sample of
$n = 60$ containing $x = 0$ misstatements against a performance materiality of
5% using a beta(1, 1) prior distribution.

In **jfa**, these results can be reproduced via the following command:

```{r}
evaluation(materiality = 0.05, method = "binomial", x = 0, n = 60, prior = TRUE)
```

## MUS (R)

**MUS** [@MUS] is an R package proving sampling and evaluation methods to apply
Monetary Unit Sampling during an audit of financial statements. The package is
available via [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MUS) and can be
downloaded with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("MUS")
```
