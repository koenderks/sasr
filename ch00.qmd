# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is intended for auditors that want to obtain the knowledge and skill
to utilize statistical audit sampling in their practice using the R programming
language. It covers an array of traditional and innovative statistical tools
that are available to auditors, explaining their function, the underlying
assumptions, and when they are best utilized. In addition, it offers practical
guidance on integrating advanced statistical sampling methodology into audit
practice and demonstrates its value through real-world case studies. It is our
hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for auditors looking to
effectively and efficiently utilize statistical methods in their practice.

The aim of this book is to address the need for a clear and transparent
explanation of the use of statistical sampling methodology in audit practice. In
my opinion, most guidance about audit sampling (e.g., @AICPA-A; @AICPA-C) lacks
sufficient detail to allow for full transparency or a deep understanding (one
notable exception is @Stewart2012). Additionally, the implementation of
statistical sampling methodology in practice is often even less transparent, as
theory and calculations are hidden from auditors in commercial closed-source
tools or in Excel sheets from audit guides used internally by audit firms. Thus,
while attempting to comprehend the theoretical aspects of statistical audit
sampling, auditors may encounter numerous relevant questions that are left
unanswered by these tools. This book aims to clarify the statistical methodology
utilized in practice, thereby empowering auditors through a comprehensive
explanation.

This book discusses two philosphies to statistical audit sampling: the classical
(frequentist) philosophy and the Bayesian philosophy. By utilizing these two
approaches, the book elucidates the statistical theory that underlies commonly
used audit sampling techniques and illustrates how to utilize these techniques
in accordance with international auditing standards. Additionally, the book
demonstrates the use of Bayesian statistical methods in auditing practice and
highlights the practical advantages that these methods can offer for auditors.

The structure of this book is as follows: Chapter 1 introduces the basics of the
R programming language. Chapter 2 discusses the fundamental statistical theory
relevant to classical and Bayesian audit sampling. Subsequent chapters (Chapters
3, 4, 5, and 6) provide a more in-depth exploration of the use of these methods
for statistical planning, selection, and evaluation of audit samples. These
chapters illustrate the practical differences and similarities between classical
and Bayesian approaches through code and examples, thus requiring minimal
programming expertise to follow along. Finally, Chapter 7 examines other
open-source software implementations of audit sampling using R.
