Welcome to the book **Statistical Audit Sampling with R**, a practical guide for
auditors that want to use state-of-the-art statistical methodology in their
audit sampling activities. While this book focuses completely on the subject of
audit sampling, it aims to discusses it from two viewpoints: the classical
(frequentist) approach and the Bayesian approach. Through these two lenses, it
explains the statistical theory underlying commonly applied audit sampling
procedures and demonstrates how to perform these procedures in a statistically
sound manner compliant with international auditing standards using the **jfa**
[@jfa] R package.
