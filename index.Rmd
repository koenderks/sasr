Welcome to the book **Statistical Audit Sampling with R**, a practical guide for
auditors that want to use state-of-the-art statistical methodology in the audit.
This book focuses on audit sampling but approaches it from two viewpoints: the
classical (frequentist) approach and the Bayesian approch. Through these two
lenses, it explains the statistical theory underlying commonly applied audit
sampling procedures, and demonstrates how to perform these procedures in a
statistically sound manner compliant with international auditing standards using
the **jfa** [@jfa] R package.

Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and a number of chapters are
still missing. If you are missing some of the content today, then check back
tomorrow: This book is actively being worked on.
