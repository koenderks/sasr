# Basic Concepts {#CHAPTER-BASIC-CONCEPTS}

Statistical audit sampling is a statistical method used by auditors to evaluate
a sample of transactions or other items within a population in order to draw
conclusions about the population as a whole. It is a cost-effective way to test
the accuracy and reliability of financial information, as it allows auditors to
test a representative sample of the population rather than the entire population.

There are two main types of audit sampling: statistical sampling and
non-statistical sampling. Statistical sampling uses probability theory to
select a sample from the population and perform inferences about the population
based on the sample. Non-statistical sampling, on the other hand, is based on
the judgment of the auditor and does not involve statistical techniques. This
book does not concern itself with non-statistical sampling.

In statistical audit sampling, the auditor first defines the population and the
sampling units, which is the unit of measurement for the population
(e.g., transactions, invoices, etc.). The auditor then selects a sample from the
population using a specified sampling method, such as random sampling or
stratified sampling.

After the sample has been selected, the auditor performs audit procedures on the
sample and records the results. The auditor then uses statistical techniques to
calculate estimates of population characteristics, such as the mean or the
proportion of items with a certain characteristic (e.g., the proportion of
items that are misstated). The auditor compares these estimates to predetermined
acceptance criteria to determine (i.e., the materiality) whether the population
meets the criteria.

One important concept in statistical audit sampling is the confidence level. The
confidence level is the probability that the sample estimate falls within a
certain range of the true population value. For example, if the confidence level
is 95%, there is a 95% probability that the sample estimate is within the
specified range of the true population value. The desired confidence level is
known to the auditor before they performs audit sampling.

Another important concept in statistical audit sampling is precision. Precision
refers to the degree to which the auditors' inferences are reliable. An estimate
with high precision is more likely to provide accurate conclusions about the
population. The precision of an estimate can be improved by increasing the
sample size.

To recap, the basic statistical concepts behind statistical audit sampling
include:

- **Population**: The entire group of items that the auditor is interested in
  studying. For example, the population may be all of the transactions in a
  company's accounts receivable.
- **Sampling unit**: A physical representation of the population to be audited.
- **Sample**: A subset of the population that is selected for testing. The
  sample should be representative of the population in order to accurately
  reflect the characteristics of the population.

In conclusion, audit sampling is a statistical method used by auditors to
evaluate a sample of transactions or other items within a population in order to
draw conclusions about the population as a whole. Statistical audit sampling
uses statistical techniques to select a sample from the population and make
inferences about the population based on the sample, while non-statistical
sampling is based on the judgment of the auditor.
