# Preface {-}

This book is intended for auditors who wish to use statistical audit sampling in
their audit practice using the R programming language. It covers an array of
traditional and cutting-edge statistical tools available to auditors, explaining
their function, the underlying assumptions, and when they should be ideally
utilized. Additionally, it provides practical suggestions for integrating
advanced statistical sampling methodology into audit practice and illustrates
its value through real-life case studies. We hope that this book will serve as a
useful resource for auditors to properly, efficiently, and effectively utilize
statistical methods in practice.

The purpose of this book is to address the need for a clear and transparent
description of the application of statistical sampling methodology in audit
practice. In my opinion, most guidance (one notable exception is @Stewart2012)
about audit sampling (e.g., @AICPA-A; @AICPA-C) lacks sufficient detail to allow
for full transparency or a deep understanding. Additionally, the implementation
of these methods in practice is often even less transparent, as theory and
calculations are hidden from the user in commercial closed-source tools or audit
guides in the form of Excel sheets used internally by audit firms. Therefore,
many auditors may try to understand the theory involved in statistical audit 
ampling, but they often end up with more questions than they began with. This
book aims to empower the auditor by providing a comprehensive explanation of the
statistical methodology used in practice.

This book examines audit sampling from both a classical frequentist perspective
and a Bayesian perspective. Through these two lenses, it explains the statistical
theory underlying commonly applied audit sampling procedures and demonstrates
how to apply these procedures in a statistically sound manner compliant with
international auditing standards. It also demonstrates the use of Bayesian
statistical methods in auditing practice, highlighting the practical benefits
these methods can bring for auditors.

This book is organized as follows. Chapter \@ref(CHAPTER-1) provides a
basic introduction to the R programming language. Chapter \@ref(CHAPTER-2)
discusses the basic statistical theory underlying audit sampling. Chapter
\@ref(CHAPTER-3) discusses the standard audit sampling workflow. Chapter
\@ref(CHAPTER-4), \@ref(CHAPTER-5), \@ref(CHAPTER-6), and \@ref(CHAPTER-7) go
into more detail about using statistial methods to plan, select and evaluate
audit samples. Finally, Chapter \@ref(CHAPTER-8) discusses other R-related
software implementations of audit sampling.
