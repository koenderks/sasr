# Preface {-}

This book is for auditors who want to employ statistical audit sampling in audit
practice using the statistical programming language R. It thoroughly, but
understandably, covers an array of state-of-the-art statistical instruments
available to auditors, explaining what they are, the assumptions on which they
are based, and when they should be used. Furthermore, it offers concrete
suggestions for incorporating advanced statistical methods into audit practice
and demonstrates their usefulness using real-life case studies. Hopefully, this
book can be a resource for the efficient and effective use of statistical
methods in audit practice.

This book adresses the need for a transparent and clear description of the
application of statistical sampling methodology in audit practice. I have found
that most guidance about audit sampling contain insufficient detail to allow for
transparent reproduction or understanding. Furthermore, the practical
implementation of these methods is often untransparent and closed-source via
commercial tools or excel sheets internally used by the audit firm. As such,
auditors may try to understand the mechanisms at play but are often left with
more questions that they arrived with. This book aims to give full control back
to the auditor when it comes to explaining the statistical methodology used
in practice.

This book focuses on audit sampling but approaches it from two viewpoints: the
classical (frequentist) approach and the Bayesian approch. Through these two
lenses, it explains the statistical theory underlying commonly applied audit
sampling procedures, and demonstrates how to perform these procedures in a
statistically sound manner compliant with international auditing standards.
It also makes the case for adopting Bayesian statistical methods in the audit
practice. Bayesian inference can bring many practical advantages for the auditor
and this book will discuss these in detail.

In part 1, Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the R programming language.
Chapter 2 gives a brief overview of how statistical methodology can be applied
in the audit. In part 2, Chapter 3 discusses the basic statistical theory
underlying audit sampling. Chapter 4 discusses the standard audit sampling
workflow. Chapter 5, 6, 7, and 8 go into more detail about using statistial
methods to plan, select and evaluate audit samples. Finally, Chapter 9 discusses
other software implementations of audit sampling. In part 3, Chapter 10
gives an overview of the basic statistical theory underlying data auditing.
