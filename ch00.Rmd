# Preface {-}

This book is for auditors who want to employ statistical audit sampling in audit
practice using the statistical programming language R. It covers an array of
conventional and state-of-the-art statistical instruments available to auditors,
explaining what they are, the assumptions on which they are based, and when they
should ideally be used. Furthermore, it offers concrete suggestions for
incorporating advanced statistical methodology into audit practice and
demonstrates its usefulness using real-life case studies. Hopefully, this book
can be a resource for the proper, efficient and effective use of statistical
methods in audit practice.

This book adresses the need for a transparent and clear description of the
application of statistical sampling methodology in audit practice. I have found
that most guidance about audit sampling contains insufficient detail to allow
for full transparentcy or a deep understanding. Furthermore, the implementation
of these methods in practice is often even less transparent, as theory and
calculations are hidden from the user in commercial closed-source tools or excel
sheets internally used by audit firms. As such, many auditors may attempt to
understand the mechanisms at play when engaging in statistical audit sampling
but are often left with more questions than at the start. This book aims to give
full control to the auditor when it comes to explaining the statistical
methodology used in practice.

This book focuses on audit sampling but approaches it from two viewpoints: a
classical (frequentist) approach and a Bayesian approch. Through these two
lenses, it explains the statistical theory underlying commonly applied audit
sampling procedures and demonstrates how to perform these procedures in a
statistically sound manner compliant with international auditing standards.
It also makes the case for adopting Bayesian statistical methods in the audit
practice and demonstrates why these methods can bring many practical advantages
for the auditor.

This book is organized as follows. Chapter \@ref(CHAPTER-1) provides a
basic introduction to the R programming language. Chapter \@ref(CHAPTER-2)
discusses the basic statistical theory underlying audit sampling. Chapter
\@ref(CHAPTER-3) discusses the standard audit sampling workflow. Chapter
\@ref(CHAPTER-4), \@ref(CHAPTER-5), \@ref(CHAPTER-6), and \@ref(CHAPTER-7) go
into more detail about using statistial methods to plan, select and evaluate
audit samples. Finally, Chapter \@ref(CHAPTER-8) discusses other R-related
software implementations of audit sampling.
