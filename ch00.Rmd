Preface {-}
========

This book is for auditors who want to use statistical methodology in the audit
using the statistical programming language R. It thoroughly, but understandably,
covers an array of statistical techniques available to auditors, explaining what
they are, the assumptions on which they are based, and when they should be used.
Furthermore, it offers concrete suggestions for incorporating statistical
methodology into audit practice and demonstrates its usefulness using practical
case studies. Hopefully, this book can be a resource for the efficient and
effective use of statistical methods in audit practice.

This book adresses the need for a transparent and clear description of the
application of statistical methods in audit practice. I have found that most
guidance about statistics in auditing and implementations of these methods
are often untransparent and closed-source tools with insufficient detail to
allow for transparent reproduction (e.g., closed Excel sheets) and understanding.
As such, many questions about how results come to be are left unanswered. This
book aims to provide full control to the auditor when it comes to explaining the
statistical methodology used.

This book focuses on two auditing procedures that are commonly performend in a
statistical manner: audit sampling and data auditing. It explains the underlying
statistical auditing theory from a classical and Bayesian point of view and
demonstrates how to perform these procedures in a sound manner compliant with
international auditing standards. Bayesian auditing procedures can have great
benefits for auditors in practice and this book will elaborate on each of them.

In part 1, Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the R programming language.
Chapter 2 gives a brief overview of how statistical methodology can be applied
in the audit. In part 2, Chapter 3 discusses the basic statistical theory
underlying audit sampling. Chapter 4 discusses the standard audit sampling
workflow. Chapter 5, 6, 7, and 8 go into more detail about using statistial
methods to plan, select and evaluate audit samples. Finally, Chapter 9 discusses
other software implementations of audit sampling. In part 3, Chapter 10
gives an overview of the basic statistical theory underlying data auditing.
