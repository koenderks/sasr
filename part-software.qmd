# Other Software {#part-software}

In addition to using the **jfa** R package for statistical audit sampling, there
are several other software options that can be incorporated into the workflow.
These options may be preferred for specific tasks or may simply provide an
alternative approach to achieving the same results.

In this part of the book, we will explore some of these other software options
and how they can be integrated into the audit sampling workflow. Chapter @jasp
discusses JASP for Audit, an open-source and user-friendly graphical user 
interface around the **jfa** R package. In Chapte @chap-packages, we will
discuss other R packages implementing statistical techniques for audit sampling.
