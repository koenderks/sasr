    "text": "Welcome\nThis book, Statistical Audit Sampling with R, is intended as a practical guide for auditors who wish to employ probability theory in their audit sampling activities. While the focus of this book is exclusively on audit sampling, it aims to discuss the topic from both the classical (frequentist) perspective and the Bayesian perspective. By examining the subject through these two lenses, the book explains the statistical theory behind commonly used audit sampling procedures and demonstrates how to perform these procedures in accordance with international auditing standards, using the jfa R package, in a statistically sound manner."

    "section": "1.1 Prerequisites",
    "text": "1.1 Prerequisites\nTo run the code in this book, you will need three things: R, RStudio, and the jfa package.\n\n1.1.1 R\nThe Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) is a collection of mirror servers distributed globally that can be utilized to obtain both R and R packages. When seeking to download R, it is recommended to utilize the cloud mirror located at https://cloud.r-project.org, as it will automatically determine the most suitable mirror for your location. Please ensure that you have at least R 3.5.0 installed for the purposes of this book.\nIt is advisable to regularly update R, as new major versions are released annually and minor releases occur two to three times per year. While upgrading can be inconvenient, particularly for major versions which require the reinstallation of all packages, failing to do so will only exacerbate the issue.\n\n\n1.1.2 RStudio\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically designed for the R programming language. It can be downloaded and installed from the official website (https://posit.co/downloads/). RStudio undergoes updates several times a year, and users will be notified when a new version becomes available. It is recommended to regularly upgrade RStudio to access the latest features. Please ensure that you have at least RStudio 1.0.0 installed for the purposes of this book.\nWhen you start RStudio, you’ll see three important regions in the interface: the console, the environment and the output panel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe console in the left panel allows you to run R code. To execute some R code, type the code in the console (e.g., 1 + 1) and press Enter. When you stored the results of a computation in a new variable (e.g., x <- 1 + 1), the variable is displayed in the environment in the top right panel. The environment allows you to keep track of the objects you have created during your R session. Finally, any plots that you request are displayed in the output panel in the bottom right.\n\n\n1.1.3 jfa\nR has many packages and libraries that extend its capabilities and provide additional functions and tools for data analysis and visualization. R packages are the core building blocks of reproducible R code. They consist of reusable functions, the documentation describing how to utilize them, and sample data. Some popular packages include dplyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 for data visualization, and caret for machine learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want to know more about creating your own R package, Wickam & Brian (2022) provides an excellent first-hand description of the principles and practices of creating R packages.\n\n\nTo illustrate its concepts and ideas, this book uses the jfa package, an R package for statistical auditing, which can also be downloaded from CRAN. This can be done via the install.packages() function by providing the package name in quotes. Thus, before running the examples in this book, you should install the jfa package by running the following command in R:\n\ninstall.packages(\"jfa\")\n\nOnce you have installed a package, you must load it into every R session. To load a package into your R session, call library() and provide the name of the package (without quotes) that you want to load. For example, before running the examples in this book, you should load the jfa package with:\n\nlibrary(jfa)\n\nR packages are updated regularly. To update a package in your R library you should call update.packages() and provide the name of the package that you want to update in quotes. For example, each time there is a new release of the jfa package, you can update it by running:\n\nupdate.packages(\"jfa\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want to look at the source code of the jfa package, see the package website."

Firstly, in a console, the user inputs their code after the prompt symbol (>) while the book does not display this symbol. Secondly, the output in the book is commented out with #>, while in a console it is displayed directly after the inputted code. Hence, those working with an electronic version of the book can directly copy code from the book to the console."

For instance, ISA 530 (International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), 2018) defines statistical audit sampling as a method that at minimum exhibits the following two characteristics:\n\nRandom selection of sample items,\nThe use of an appropriate statistical technique to evaluate sample results, including measurement of sampling risk\n\nAccording to auditing standards, any sampling approach that lacks these two characteristics is considered nonstatistical sampling.\nIn order to effectively utilize statistical sampling during an audit, it is necessary to tailor the approach to the specific circumstances of the audit. This may involve considering factors such as the size and complexity of the population, the materiality of the items being tested, and the level of inherent risk in the audit area. It is also essential for the auditor to document the sampling process in order to demonstrate compliance with auditing standards. The following sections will delve further into these crucial concepts in the context of statistical audit sampling."

    "section": "2.2 Important Concepts",
    "text": "2.2 Important Concepts\nThis section aims to delve into several theoretical concepts that are integral to statistical audit sampling.\n\n2.2.1 Materiality\nIn an audit, materiality is the maximum amount of misstatement that can be present in the financial statements of the auditee before the auditor concludes that the financical statements are materially misstated, meaning that they contains misstatements that would influence the decisions of stakeholders relying on those statements.\nThe term performance materiality refers to the maximum amount of misstatement that can be present in a given population that is part of the financial statements before the auditor concludes that the population is materially misstated. Performance materiality is used by auditors to determine the appropriate level of testing to be performed on a population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe performance materiality is usually defined to be lower than the materiality because an individual population that is subject to audit sampling is often only a (small) part of the financial statements.\n\n\nFor example, consider an audit of a company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. The auditor determines that the company’s accounts receivable balance is a large part of to the financial statements and decides to test a sample of the accounts receivable transactions to assess the accuracy of the balance. The auditor calculates the performance materiality for the accounts receivable balance by considering the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. If the auditor finds misstatements in the sample such that their estimate of the misstatement exceeds the performance materiality, the auditor would need to express an unqualified opinion on the population or would need to perform additional testing on the population. If the auditor finds misstatements in the sample such that their estimate of the misstatement does not exceed the performance materiality, the auditor would express a positive opinion on the financial statements.\n\n\n2.2.2 Audit risk\nAfter completing an audit and making any necessary corrections, an auditor will issue a written report stating whether the financial statements are accurate and free of material misstatement. The potential for this opinion to be incorrect is known as audit risk, and it is the auditor’s job to minimize this risk as much as possible.\nFor example, during an audit of a company’s financial statements, the auditor may carefully review documentation, perform tests of details via audit sampling, and speak with management in order to reduce the audit risk and provide a reliable opinion on the accuracy of the financial statements as a whole.\n\n\n2.2.3 Population\nIn statistical inference, the term population refers to the entire group of individuals or items that have some common characteristic or interest, and about which we want to gather data or make inferences. A population can be as large as all the people in a country or, as is more sensible in auditing, as small as a group of employees in a specific department of a company.\nFor example, consider an audit of a company’s payroll records. The population in this case would be all the employees of the company, and the goal of the audit would be to gather data on their salaries, benefits, and other payroll-related information. The audit team would collect this data from a a representative group of employees (i.e., a sample) of the population and use statistical methods to draw conclusions about the entire population.\n\n\n2.2.4 Sampling risk\nThere is a possibility that the results of an audit based on a sample may differ from the results if the entire population were examined using the same procedures. This is known as sampling risk. Sampling risk can result in two types of incorrect conclusions:\n\nThe first type is when, in a test of controls, the controls are perceived to be more effective than they actually are, or in a test of details, a material misstatement is believed to not exist when it actually does. This type of erroneous conclusion is particularly concerning for auditors because it can compromise the effectiveness of the audit and may lead to an inappropriate audit opinion.\nThe second type of incorrect conclusion is when, in a test of controls, the controls are perceived to be less effective than they actually are, or in a test of details, a material misstatement is believed to exist when it actually does not. This type of erroneous conclusion impacts the efficiency of the audit as it may require additional work to determine that the initial conclusions were incorrect.\n\nMany audits are performed according to the audit risk model (ARM), which determines that the uncertainty about the auditor’s statement as a whole is a factor of three terms: the inherent risk, the control risk, and the detection risk (i.e., the sampling risk). Inherent risk is the risk posed by a misstatement in the auditees financial statements that could be material, before consideration of any related control systems (e.g., computer systems). Control risk is the risk that a material misstatement is not prevented or detected by the auditee’s internal control systems. Detection risk is the risk that the auditor will fail to find material misstatements that exist in the auditee’s financial statements. The ARM is practically useful because, for a given level of audit risk, the tolerable detection risk bears an inverse relation to the other two risks.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\text{Audit risk} = \\text{Inherent risk} \\times \\text{Control risk} \\times \\text{Detection risk}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nUsually the auditor judges inherent risk and control risk on a three-point scale consisting of low, medium, and high. Different audit firms handle different standard percentages for these categories. Given an assessment of the inherent risk and the control risk, the detection risk can be calculated as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\text{Detection risk} = \\frac{\\text{Audit risk}}{\\text{Inherent risk} \\times \\text{Control risk}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe ARM is commonly used in practice, but is not a proper model of audit risk. For example, it is not possible to set one of the risks to zero, as that would result in an infinite detection risk (e.g., \\(\\frac{0.05}{0 \\times 1} = \\infty\\)).\n\n\nLet’s consider an example. Suppose that, in their audit guide, an audit firm associates the following percentages with the categories high, medium and low:\n\nHigh: 100%\nMedium: 60%\nLow: 50%\n\nIf an auditor is working with an audit risk of 5%, and judges inherent and control risk to both be medium, the sampling risk can be calculated as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\frac{0.05}{0.6 \\times 0.6} = 0.139\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n2.2.5 Sample Size\nThe sample size is an important consideration in the context of audit sampling, as it determines the number of items that will be selected for testing during the audit process. This factor has an impact on both effectiveness and efficiency. In general, a larger sample size can provide a higher level of assurance, but it requires more audit effort to obtain and inspect. On the other hand, a smaller sample size offers a lower level of assurance, but it is less costly.\n\n\n2.2.6 Notation\nThe table below summarizes the notation used in this book (middle column) and in the jfa R package (right column).\n\n\n\nMeaning\nSymbol\njfa\n\n\n\n\nProbability of misstatement\n\\(\\theta\\)\n\n\n\nPerformance materiality\n\\(\\theta_{max}\\)\nmateriality\n\n\nExpected deviation rate\n\\(\\theta_{exp}\\)\nexpected\n\n\nType-I error probability\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n1 - conf.level\n\n\nType-II error probability\n\\(\\beta\\)\n\n\n\nPopulation size\n\\(N\\)\nN.units\n\n\nPopulation misstatements\n\\(K\\)\n\n\n\nSample size\n\\(n\\)\nn\n\n\nObserved misstatements\n\\(k\\)\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).

    "section": "3.1 Classical Inference",
    "text": "3.1 Classical Inference\nFrequentist statistics, also known as classical statistics, is a statistical framework that is based on the concept of probability as a long-term frequency of events. This approach assumes that statistical models are purely objective and that data is generated by a well-defined process, which can be described by a set of probabilistic assumptions. The philosophy behind frequentist statistics is that statistical estimates should be based on the frequency of events in a population, rather than on subjective or personal beliefs. This approach is particularly useful for making predictions or making decisions based on data, as it allows for the calculation of confidence intervals and statistical tests, which provide a measure of the reliability of the estimates. Overall, frequentist statistics is a rigorous and reliable approach that is widely used in the scientific community for making informed decisions based on data.\n\n3.1.1 Estimation\nThe philosophy behind frequentist parameter estimation is based on the idea that statistical parameters are fixed, but unknown, quantities that can be estimated through the process of repeated sampling. This approach assumes that the sample data represent a random sample from a larger population, and that the sample statistics (i.e., the sample proportion of misstatements) can be used to estimate the corresponding population parameters (i.e., the population misstatement). The key principle of frequentist estimation is that the estimated parameter values should be unbiased and have a certain level of uncertainty, which can be quantified through confidence bounds or intervals.\n\n3.1.1.1 Example\nAs an example, the binom.test() function in R can be used to estimate the rate of misstatement in a population given a data sample of \\(n\\) items containing \\(k\\) misstatements. Suppose an auditor audited a sample of \\(n = 60\\) items containing \\(k = 0\\) misstatements. To use the binom.test() function to perform estimation, the auditor must input the number of items in the sample n = 60, the number of misstatements in the sample x = 0, and the hypothesized proportion of misstatement in the population (i.e., the performance materiality), which is irrelevant and should thus be sert to p = 1. The sampling risk is set to 5%, which the auditor can provide to the function with conf.level = 1 - 0.05. Finally, the auditor can specify the alternative hypothesis as alternative = \"less\" to compute a one-sided confidence interval since they are interested in obtaining the upper confidence bound.\n\nbinom.test(x = 0, n = 60, p = 1, alternative = \"less\", conf.level = 0.95)\n#> \n#>  Exact binomial test\n#> \n#> data:  0 and 60\n#> number of successes = 0, number of trials = 60, p-value < 2.2e-16\n#> alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is less than 1\n#> 95 percent confidence interval:\n#>  0.00000000 0.04870291\n#> sample estimates:\n#> probability of success \n#>                      0\n\nThe most likely misstatement in the population is displayed under sample estimates and is 0%. The 95% upper confidence bound for the estimate of the population misstatement is displayed under 95 percent confidence interval and is 4.87%.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Hypothesis Testing\nFrequentist hypothesis testing is a statistical method that involves evaluating the probability of obtaining a certain sample outcome or more extreme, given a certain assumption or hypothesis. This probability, known as the p value, is used to determine the likelihood of the hypothesis being true.\nFor example, in a typical audit sampling hypothesis test using the binomial distribution, we may be interested in testing the hypothesis that the misstatement is higher or lower than the performance materiality. We would inspect a sample and calculate the p value based on the observed frequency of misstatements versus the expected frequency under the assumption of material misstatement. If the p value is below the sampling risk \\(\\alpha\\), we reject the hypothesis that the population is materially misstated and conclude that it is not materially misstated.\n\n\n\nInnovating statistical methods and shaping the field of genetics, Sir Ronald Fisher was a pioneer in the world of science. Image available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 license.\n\n\n\n3.1.2.1 Example\nNext to estimation, the binom.test() function in R can also be used to test if a population contains is free of material misstatement, which in this case means that the population contains less than 3 percent misstatements. Suppose an auditor obtained a sample of \\(n = 100\\) items containing \\(k = 0\\) misstatements. To use the binom.test() function, the auditor must input the number of items in the sample n = 100, the number of misstatements in the sample x = 0, and the hypothesized proportion of misstatement in the population (i.e., the performance materiality) p = 0.03. The sampling risk is set to 5%, which the auditor can provide to the function with conf.level = 1 - 0.05. Finally, the auditor can specify the alternative hypothesis as alternative = \"less\" to test if the proportion of misstatements in the sample is less than the hypothesized proportion.\n\nbinom.test(x = 0, n = 100, p = 0.03, alternative = \"less\", conf.level = 0.95)\n#> \n#>  Exact binomial test\n#> \n#> data:  0 and 100\n#> number of successes = 0, number of trials = 100, p-value = 0.04755\n#> alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is less than 0.03\n#> 95 percent confidence interval:\n#>  0.00000000 0.02951305\n#> sample estimates:\n#> probability of success \n#>                      0\n\nThe p value is shown under p-value and is 0.04755.

    "text": "3.2 Bayesian Inference\nBayesian inference is based on the idea that the parameters in a statistical model are not fixed but uncertain. In this approach, the parameter is onsidered to be a random variable with a certain distribution, and the goal is to use the data and any prior knowledge about the parameter to update our belief about its value. This is typically done using Bayes’ theorem, which states that the posterior probability (i.e., the updated belief about the parameter after seeing the data) is equal to the prior probability (i.e., the belief about the parameter before seeing the data) times the likelihood (i.e., the probability of the data given the parameter).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\text{Posterior} \\propto \\text{Likelihood} \\times \\text{Prior}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nBayesian statistics is a more nuanced approach that allows for more efficiency in statistical audit sampling, but it requires the specification of prior distributions that can be difficult to quantify. That is because, especially in an audit, all information that is incorporated into the statistical analysis should be based on audit evidence and should be properly justified.\n\n3.2.1 Estimation\nOne major difference between classical and Bayesian statistics is the way they handle uncertainty. In classical statistics, uncertainty is represented by the standard error of an estimate, which is a measure of the precision of an estimate. In Bayesian statistics, uncertainty is represented by the posterior distribution, which is a distribution of the possible values of the population parameter given the sample data and our prior beliefs. Bayesian inferences uses uses Bayes’ theorem to update the prior beliefs about the population parameter with the new information from the sample data. Bayes’ theorem is given by the following formula:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  p(\\theta | y) = \\frac{p(y | \\theta)p(\\theta)}{p(y)}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(p(\\theta | y)\\) is the posterior probability of the population parameter \\(\\theta\\) given the sample data \\(y\\), \\(p(y | \\theta)\\) is the likelihood of the sample data given \\(\\theta\\), \\(p(\\theta)\\) is the prior probability of \\(\\theta\\), and \\(p(y)\\) is the total probability of the sample data occurring. Because with a fixed sample \\(p(y)\\) is a constant, Bayes’ theorem is often given as follows:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  p(\\theta | y) \\propto p(y | \\theta) \\times p(\\theta)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\nThomas Bayes revolutionized the world of statistics and probability with his groundbreaking work on Bayes’ Theorem. His contributions continue to shape the way we understand and analyze data today. Image available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 license.\n\n\n\n3.2.1.1 Example\nBayesian inference involves first specifying a prior distribution that captures the available information about the probability of misstatement in the population. For illustrative purposes, we use a simple prior distribution that is indifferent about the possible values of the misstatement. Note that this prior distribution does not contain any information about the probability of misstatement, but yields statistical results that closely resemble classical outcomes. Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 dive deeper into the R functions from the jfa package used in this example, such as the auditPrior() function below.\n\nprior <- auditPrior(method = \"default\", likelihood = \"binomial\")\nplot(prior)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing an item from the population, the prior distribution is updated to the posterior distribution by means of Bayes’ theorem. Next, the posterior is used as a prior distribution for the following item, which is once again updated to a posterior distribution after seeing another the item. This process of updating the prior distribution to a posterior distribution, and using the posterior as a prior can continue indefinately. For example, after seeing 30 items from the population, of which none contained a misstatement, the posterior distribution peaks at zero, reflecting the fact that no misstatements were found, and its mass has shifted towards zero when compared to the prior distribution, reflecting the fact that the data contained information that indicates a low probability of misstatement.\n\neval <- evaluation(x = 0, n = 30, method = \"binomial\", prior = prior)\nplot(eval)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most likely value of the population misstatement based on these data is shown as a point above the highest point of the posterior distribution. The uncertainty about the population misstatement can be quantified using a credible interval (shown as a line above the posterior distribution). In this case, the figure above shows a 95% credible interval, which contains the true value of the population misstatement with a 95% probability.\nAfter seeing 30 more observations, of which none contained a misstatement, the mass of the posterior distribution has shifted towards zero even more. The credible interval shown above the posterior distribution encompasses a smaller range of values, reflecting the fact that additional information has been observed and thus that there is less uncertainty about the population misstatement than before.\n\neval <- evaluation(x = 0, n = 30, method = \"binomial\", prior = eval$posterior)\nplot(eval)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updating process works the same for the scenario in which the auditor finds misstatements in the sample. For example, the posterior distribution after finding a single misstatement is has its mass shifted away from zero, reflecting the fact that a probability of zero is unlikely given the sample data.\n\neval <- evaluation(x = 1, n = 1, method = \"binomial\", prior = eval$posterior)\nplot(eval)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Hypothesis Testing\nThe Bayes factor is a measure used in Bayesian inference to compare the relative strength of evidence between two competing hypotheses. The Bayes factor is calculated by comparing the probability of the observed data given each of the two competing hypotheses. This probability is known as the likelihood of the data. The Bayes factor is then the ratio of the likelihood of the data under one hypothesis to the likelihood of the data under the other hypothesis. The Bayes factor can be used in the context of an audit, where the auditor is trying to determine the likelihood that a particular financial statement is represented fairly or not.\nFor example, an auditor might be evaluating the fairness of a company’s financial statements for the year. They have two hypotheses: the first is that the statements are accurate, and the second is that the statements are not accurate. The auditor gathers data from a statistical audit sample and uses this data to calculate the Bayes factor.\nThe Bayes factor is calculated by taking the ratio of the probability of the first hypothesis (that the statements are accurate) given the observed data, to the probability of the second hypothesis (that the statements are not accurate) given the observed data. The higher the Bayes factor, the more likely it is that the first hypothesis is true.\nThe Bayes factor can be used to assess the strength of evidence for one hypothesis over the other and to determine which hypothesis is more likely to be true given the observed data. It is often used in scientific research to help evaluate the validity of different hypotheses and to make informed decisions based on the available evidence. For auditors, the Bayes factor can be a useful tool to determine the likelihood of different hypotheses being true based on the data they have collected, and it can help them make informed decisions about the fairness of the financial statements.\nFor example, if the Bayes factor is 5, this means that the probability of the statements being accurate given the observed data is 5 times higher than the probability of them being not accurate. In this case, the auditor would be more likely to conclude that the financial statements are accurate.\n\n\n\nSir Harold Jeffreys innovated statistical hypothesis testing with his Bayes factor approach, helping us make better decision in the face of uncertainty. Image available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 license.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.1 Example\nSuppose an auditor obtained a sample of \\(n = 100\\) items containing \\(k = 0\\) misstatements. Given the number of items in the sample n = 100, the number of misstatements in the sample x = 0, and the hypothesized proportion of misstatement in the population (i.e., the performance materiality) p = 0.03 the Bayes factor is displayed under BF10 and is 668.65, meaning that it the data are about 668 times more likely to occur under the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement than under the hypothesis of intolerable misstatement.\n\nevaluation(materiality = 0.03, x = 0, n = 100, method = \"binomial\", prior = TRUE)\n#> \n#>  Bayesian Audit Sample Evaluation\n#> \n#> data:  0 and 100\n#> number of errors = 0, number of samples = 100, taint = 0, BF₁₀ =\n#> 668.65\n#> alternative hypothesis: true misstatement rate is less than 0.03\n#> 95 percent credible interval:\n#>  0.00000000 0.02922515\n#> most likely estimate:\n#>  0 \n#> results obtained via method 'binomial' + 'prior'"

    "text": "4.1 Required Information\nFirst, planning a minimum sample requires knowledge of the conditions that lead to acceptance or rejection of the population (i.e., the sampling objectives). Typically, sampling objectives can be classified into one or both of the following:\n\nHypothesis testing: The goal of the sample is to obtain evidence for or against the claim that the misstatement in the population is lower than a given value (i.e., the performance materiality). Note that if this sampling objective is not specified, the performance materiality can be set to 1.\nEstimation: The goal of the sample is to obtain an accurate estimate of the misstatement in the population (with a minimum precision). Note that if this sampling objective is not specified, the minimum precision can be set to 1.\n\nSecond, it is advised to specify the expected (or tolerable) misstatements in the sample. The expected misstatements are the misstatements that you allow in the sample, while still retaining the desired amount of assurance about the population. It is strongly recommended to set the value for the expected misstatements in the sample conservatively to minimize the chance of the observed misstatements in the sample exceeding the expected misstatements, which would imply that insufficient work has been done in the end to reduce the sampling risk to an appropriately low level.\nFinally, next to determining the sampling objective(s) and the expected misstatements, it is important to determine the statistical distribution linking the sample outcomes to the population misstatement. This distribution is called the likelihood (i.e., poisson, binomial, or hypergeometric). All three aforementioned likelihoods are commonly used in an audit sampling context, however, poisson is the default likelihood in jfa because it is the most conservative of the three. In the subsections below, we elaborate on the three standard likelihoods for audit sampling and demonstrate how they can be used to obtain a minimum sample size.\nIn jfa, determining an appropriate sample size is achieved via the planning() function.\n\n\n\nWhen the sampling objectives, the expected misstatements and the likelihood are set, there exists only one sample size that minimizes the amount of audit effort.

It assumes that samples are drawn from the population without replacement, and is therefore the likelihood that most closely resembles the audit practice. For our purpose, we can use the hypergeometric distribution as a likelihood to model the number of misstatements that are expected to be found in the sample.\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the hypergeometric distribution is given by:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  p(X = k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the number of misstatements in the sample, \\(n\\) is the sample size, \\(N\\) is the population size and \\(K\\) is the total number of misstatements assumed in the population. The assumed misstatements \\(K\\) is a whole number, that is, a linear extrapolation of the maximum tolerable misstatement rate (i.e., the performance materiality) \\(\\theta_{max}\\) to the total population of size \\(N\\):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  K = \\lceil \\theta_{max} N \\rceil.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\\(\\lceil...\\rceil\\) is the ceiling function, which means that \\(\\lceil1.2\\rceil = 2\\).\n\n\nLet’s consider how to use the hypergeometric likelihood to calculate the minimum sample size needed to reduce the sampling risk to an appropriately low level.\n\n4.2.1 Classical planning\nIn classical planning using the hypergeometric likelihood, the following statistical model is specified:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  k \\sim \\text{Hypergeometric}(n, N, K)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nGiven the performance materiality \\(\\theta_{max}\\), we can compute \\(K\\) and solve for the minimum sample size \\(n\\) needed to reduce the sampling risk to an appropriately low level.

The argument by sets the increment between possible sample sizes for consideration. For example, by = 5 considers only samples of size 10, 20, 30, etc:\n\nplanning(materiality = 0.03, expected = 0, conf.level = 0.95, likelihood = \"hypergeometric\", N.units = 1000, by = 10)\n#> \n#>  Classical Audit Sample Planning\n#> \n#> minimum sample size = 100 \n#> sample size obtained in 11 iterations via method 'hypergeometric'\n\nThe argument max sets the sample size at which the algorithm terminates.

Practically, this means that you should provide an input for the prior argument in the planning() function.\nSetting prior = TRUE performs Bayesian planning using a default prior conjugate to the specified likelihood (i.e., a beta-binomial prior). Because this is a Bayesian analysis, the following statistical model is specified:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  k &\\sim \\text{Hypergeometric}(n, N, K) \\\\\n  K &\\sim \\text{Beta-binomial}(N, \\alpha, \\beta)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe beta-binomial prior distribution is the conjugate prior for to the hypergeometric likelihood (see this list of conjugate priors), which means that the posterior distribution of \\(K\\) can be determined analytically. For example, if the prior distribution for \\(K\\) is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  K \\sim \\text{Beta-binomial}(N, \\alpha, \\beta) \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, K = 0, \\ldots, N\n\\end{equation}\\]\nand the auditor has observed a sample of \\(n\\) items containing \\(k\\) misstatements, then the posterior distribution for \\(K\\) is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  K \\sim \\text{Beta-binomial}(N - n, \\alpha + k, \\beta + k - n) \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, K = k, k + 1, \\ldots, N - n + k.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\n4.2.2.1 No Expected Misstatements\nPlanning for no expected misstatements in the sample can be done by setting the value for the expected argument to zero. If we want to achieve an assurance level of 95% (\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)) for a performance materiality of \\(\\theta_{max} = 0.1\\) in a population of \\(N = 20\\) items, then the required sample size under the assumption of zero expected misstatements in the sample is \\(n = 15\\). The command below uses a default beta-binomial(\\(N\\), 1, 1) prior distribution to plan this sample, since planning() is given the hypergeometric likelihood.\n\nplan <- planning(materiality = 0.1, expected = 0, conf.level = 0.95, likelihood = \"hypergeometric\", N.units = 20, prior = TRUE)\n\nThe summary() function can be used to obatain relevant information about the planning.\n\nsummary(plan)\n#> \n#>  Bayesian Audit Sample Planning Summary\n#> \n#> Options:\n#>   Confidence level:              0.95 \n#>   Population size:               20 \n#>   Materiality:                   0.1 \n#>   Hypotheses:                    H₀: Θ > 0.1 vs. H₁: Θ < 0.1 \n#>   Expected:                      0 \n#>   Likelihood:                    hypergeometric \n#>   Prior distribution:            beta-binomial(N = 20, α = 1, β = 1) \n#> \n#> Results:\n#>   Minimum sample size:           15 \n#>   Tolerable errors:              0 \n#>   Posterior distribution:        beta-binomial(N = 5, α = 1, β = 16) \n#>   Expected most likely error:    0 \n#>   Expected upper bound:          0.05 \n#>   Expected precision:            0.05 \n#>   Expected BF₁₀:                 190\n\nYou can inspect how the prior distribution compares to the expected posterior distribution by using the plot() function.

Hence, they will need to set \\(k\\) to a different integer value, which consequently determines how the sample size is calculated. Here, we can iteratively try every value of \\(n\\) and return the smallest integer that satisfies the sampling objectives.\nIn jfa, this can be done by adjusting the expected argument in the planning() function. For example, if we want to achieve an assurance level of 95% (\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)) for a performance materiality of \\(\\theta_{max} = 0.03\\), then the required sample size under the assumption of one expected misstatement in the sample is \\(n = 157\\).\n\nplan <- planning(materiality = 0.03, expected = 1, conf.level = 0.95, likelihood = \"binomial\")\n\nOnce again, the sample size of 157 can be confirmed by checking that 157 is the minimum integer that results in less than 5% probability of finding 0 or 1 misstatements, given the assumption that the population misstatement is truly 3%. By calculating this probability for \\(n = 156\\), we can show that this sample size is insufficient as the relevant probability is higher than the sampling risk \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nsum(dbinom(x = 0:1, size = 156, prob = 0.03)) < 0.05\n#> [1] FALSE\n\nHowever, for \\(n = 157\\) the relevant probability is lower than the sampling risk \\(\\alpha\\) and thus the sample size is considered to be sufficient.\n\nsum(dbinom(x = 0:1, size = 157, prob = 0.03)) < 0.05\n#> [1] TRUE\n\nLike before, we can make this sample size visually intuitive by showing the binomial(\\(k\\) | 157, 0.03) distribution and highlighting the probabilities for \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = 1\\). The sum of these probabilities is lower than the required sampling risk \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\n\nplot(plan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1.3 Expected Misstatement Rate\nWhen the expected misstatement rate in the sample \\(\\theta_{exp}\\) is assessed, the value for \\(k\\) can be determined as \\(k = n\\theta_{exp}\\), which consequently determines how the sample size can be calculated.\nTo account for the fact that \\(k\\) can have non-integer values in this case, we can use a well-known similarity between the binomial distribution and the beta distribution to plan the sample size. The upper bound for any binomial(\\(k\\); \\(n\\), \\(\\theta\\)) distributed variable can also be obtained via percentiles of the beta(\\(1 + k\\), \\(n - k\\)) distribution.\nFor example, the upper bound for a sample of \\(n = 10\\) items containing \\(k = 2\\) misstatements, when calculated via the traditional binom.test() is:\n\nub_binom <- binom.test(x = 2, n = 10, p = 0.03, conf.level = 0.95, alternative = \"less\")$conf.int[2]\nub_binom\n#> [1] 0.5069013\n\nWhen calculated via the beta relationship, the upper bound is:\n\nub_beta <- qbeta(p = 0.95, shape1 = 1 + 2, shape2 = 10 - 2)\nub_beta\n#> [1] 0.5069013\n\nIt can be validated that the two approaches result in the same upper bound via:\n\nub_binom == ub_beta\n#> [1] TRUE\n\nThis relationship between the binomial likelihood and the beta distribution is deliberately not used in jfa. That is because, in the case of the binomial distribution, the auditing standards round the tolerable misstatements upwards to a whole number. For example, if we try to call the planning() function with the argument expected = 1.5, jfa will internally convert this to expected = 2 and base the sample size on this in order to stay compliant with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) (2016). The resulting sample size is \\(n = 208\\) in this case.\n\nplanning(materiality = 0.03, expected = 1.5, conf.level = 0.95, likelihood = \"binomial\")\n#> Using 'expected = 2' since 'expected' must be a single integer >= 0\n#> \n#>  Classical Audit Sample Planning\n#> \n#> minimum sample size = 208 \n#> sample size obtained in 206 iterations via method 'binomial'\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Bayesian Planning\nPerforming Bayesian planning using the binomial likelihood requires that you specify a prior distribution for the parameter \\(\\theta\\). Practically, this means that you should provide an input for the prior argument in the planning() function.\nSetting prior = TRUE performs Bayesian planning using a default prior conjugate to the specified likelihood (i.e., a beta prior). Because this is a Bayesian analysis, the following statistical model is specified:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  k &\\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, \\theta) \\\\\n  \\theta &\\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe beta prior distribution is the conjugate prior for the binomial likelihood (see this list of conjugate priors), which means that the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) can be determined analytically. For example, if the prior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\theta \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta) \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\theta \\in [0, 1]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nand the auditor has observed a sample of \\(n\\) items containing \\(k\\) misstatements, then the posterior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\theta \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha + k, \\beta + n - k) \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\theta \\in [0, 1].\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nFor example, the command below uses a default beta(\\(\\alpha=1\\), \\(\\beta=1\\)) prior distribution to plan the sample, since planning() is given the binomial likelihood. If we want to achieve an assurance level of 95% (\\(\\alpha=0.05\\)) for a performance materiality of \\(\\theta_{max} = 0.03\\), then the required sample size under the assumption of zero expected misstatements in the sample is \\(n = 98\\).\n\nplan <- planning(materiality = 0.03, expected = 0, conf.level = 0.95, likelihood = \"binomial\", prior = TRUE)\n\nThe summary() function can be used to obatain relevant information about the planning.\n\nsummary(plan)\n#> \n#>  Bayesian Audit Sample Planning Summary\n#> \n#> Options:\n#>   Confidence level:              0.95 \n#>   Materiality:                   0.03 \n#>   Hypotheses:                    H₀: Θ > 0.03 vs. H₁: Θ < 0.03 \n#>   Expected:                      0 \n#>   Likelihood:                    binomial \n#>   Prior distribution:            beta(α = 1, β = 1) \n#> \n#> Results:\n#>   Minimum sample size:           98 \n#>   Tolerable errors:              0 \n#>   Posterior distribution:        beta(α = 1, β = 99) \n#>   Expected most likely error:    0 \n#>   Expected upper bound:          0.029807 \n#>   Expected precision:            0.029807 \n#>   Expected BF₁₀:                 627.22\n\nYou can inspect how the prior distribution compares to the expected posterior distribution by using the plot() function.

However, the Poisson likelihood is more conservative than the binomial likelihood, meaning that resulting sample sizes will be higher.\n\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  p(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the number of misstatements in the sample, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the average number of misstatements expected in the sample.

The default priors in jfa are:\n\nlikelihood = 'poisson': gamma(\\(\\alpha\\) = 1, \\(\\beta\\) = 1)\nlikelihood = 'binomial': beta(\\(\\alpha\\) = 1, \\(\\beta\\) = 1)\nlikelihood = 'hypergeometric': beta-binomial(N, \\(\\alpha\\) = 1, \\(\\beta\\) = 1)\nlikelihood = 'normal': normal(\\(\\mu\\) = 0, \\(\\sigma\\) = 1000)\nlikelihood = 'uniform': uniform(min = 0, max = 1)\nlikelihood = 'cauchy': Cauchy(\\(x_0\\) = 0, \\(\\gamma\\) = 1000)\nlikelihood = 't': Student-t(df = 1)\nlikelihood = 'chisq': chi-squared(df = 1)\nlikelihood = 'exponential': exponential(\\(\\lambda\\) = 1)\n\n\nprior <- auditPrior(method = \"default\", likelihood = \"binomial\")\nsummary(prior)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution Summary\n#> \n#> Options:\n#>   Likelihood:                    binomial \n#>   Specifics:                     default prior \n#> \n#> Results:\n#>   Functional form:               beta(α = 1, β = 1) \n#>   Mode:                          NaN \n#>   Mean:                          0.5 \n#>   Median:                        0.5 \n#>   Variance:                      0.083333 \n#>   Skewness:                      0 \n#>   Information entropy (nat):     0 \n#>   95 percent upper bound:        0.95 \n#>   Precision:                     NaN\n\nAll prior distributions can be visually inspected via the plot() function.\n\nplot(prior)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the predict() function produces the predictions of the prior distribution on the data level for a sample of n items. For example, the command below requests the prediction of the default beta(1, 1) prior for a hypothetical sample of 6 items.\n\npredict(prior, n = 6)\n#>       x=0       x=1       x=2       x=3       x=4       x=5       x=6 \n#> 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571\n\nThe predictions of the prior distribution can be visualized using the plot() function.\n\nplot(predict(prior, n = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.2 Parametric Prior\nYou can manually specify the parameters of the prior distribution with method = 'param' and the alpha and beta arguments, which correspond to the first and (optionally) second parameter of the prior as described above. For example, the commands below create a beta(2, 10) prior distribution, a normal(0.025, 0.05) prior distribution and a Student-t(0.01) prior distribution.\n\nauditPrior(method = \"param\", likelihood = \"binomial\", alpha = 2, beta = 10)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: beta(α = 2, β = 10) \n#> parameters obtained via method 'param'\nauditPrior(method = \"param\", likelihood = \"normal\", alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.05)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: normal(μ = 0.025, σ = 0.05)T[0,1] \n#> parameters obtained via method 'param'\nauditPrior(method = \"param\", likelihood = \"t\", alpha = 0.01)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: Student-t(df = 0.01)T[0,1] \n#> parameters obtained via method 'param'\n\n\n\n4.5.3 Improper Prior\nYou can construct an improper prior distribution with classical properties using method = 'strict'. The posterior distribution of from this prior yields the same results as the classical methodology with respect to sample sizes and upper limits, but is only proper once a single non-misstated unit is present in the sample (Derks et al., 2022a). For example, the command below creates an improper beta(1, 0) prior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method requires the poisson, binomial or hypergeometric likelihood.\n\n\n\n\nauditPrior(method = \"strict\", likelihood = \"binomial\")\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: beta(α = 1, β = 0) \n#> parameters obtained via method 'strict'\n\n\n\n4.5.4 Impartial Prior\nYou can incorporate the assumption that tolerable misstatement is equally likely as intolerable misstatement (Derks et al., 2022a) using method = 'impartial'. For example, the command below creates an impartial beta prior distribution for a performance materiality of 5 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method requires that you specify a value for the materiality.\n\n\n\n\nauditPrior(method = \"impartial\", likelihood = \"binomial\", materiality = 0.05)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: beta(α = 1, β = 13.513) \n#> parameters obtained via method 'impartial'\n\n\n\n4.5.5 Probability of Tolerable Misstatement\nYou can manually assign prior probabilities to the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement and the hypotheses of intolerable misstatement (Derks et al., 2021) with method = 'hyp' in combination with p.hmin. For example, the command below incorporates the information that the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement has a probability of 60% into a beta prior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method requires that you specify a value for the materiality.\n\n\n\n\nauditPrior(method = \"hyp\", likelihood = \"binomial\", materiality = 0.05, p.hmin = 0.6)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: beta(α = 1, β = 17.864) \n#> parameters obtained via method 'hyp'\n\n\n\n4.5.6 Audit Risk Model\nYou can translate risk assessments from the Audit Risk Model (inherent risk and internal control risk) into a prior distribution (Derks et al., 2021) using method = 'arm' in combination with the ir and cr arguments. For example, the command below incorporates the information that the inherent risk is equal to 90% and internal control risk is equal to 60% into a beta prior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method requires the poisson, binomial or hypergeometric likelihood.\n\n\n\n\nauditPrior(method = \"arm\", likelihood = \"binomial\", materiality = 0.05, ir = 0.9, cr = 0.6)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: beta(α = 1, β = 12) \n#> parameters obtained via method 'arm'\n\n\n\n4.5.7 Bayesian Risk Assessment Model\nYou can incorporate information about the mode and the upper bound of the prior distribution using method = 'bram'. For example, the code below incorporates the information that the mode of the prior distribution is 1% and the upper bound is 60% into a beta prior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method requires the poisson, binomial or hypergeometric likelihood.\n\n\n\n\nauditPrior(method = \"bram\", likelihood = \"binomial\", materiality = 0.05, expected = 0.01, ub = 0.6)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: beta(α = 1.023, β = 3.317) \n#> parameters obtained via method 'bram'\n\n\n\n4.5.8 Earlier Sample\nYou can incorporate information from an earlier sample into the prior distribution (Derks et al., 2021) using method = 'sample' in combination with x and n. For example, the command below incorporates the information from an earlier sample of 30 items in which 0 misstatements were found into a beta prior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method requires the poisson, binomial or hypergeometric likelihood.\n\n\n\n\nauditPrior(method = \"sample\", likelihood = \"binomial\", x = 0, n = 30)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: beta(α = 1, β = 30) \n#> parameters obtained via method 'sample'\n\n\n\n4.5.9 Weighted Earlier Sample\nYou can incorporate information from last years results, weighted by a factor (Derks et al., 2021), into the prior distribution using method = 'factor' in combination with x and n. For example, the command below incorporates the information from a last years results (a sample of 58 items in which 0 misstatements were found), weighted by a factor 0.7, into a beta prior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method requires the poisson, binomial or hypergeometric likelihood.\n\n\n\n\nauditPrior(method = \"factor\", likelihood = \"binomial\", x = 0, n = 58, factor = 0.7)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: beta(α = 1, β = 40.6) \n#> parameters obtained via method 'factor'\n\n\n\n4.5.10 Nonparametric Prior\nYou can base the prior on samples of the prior distribution using method = 'nonparam' in combination with samples. For example, the command below creates a prior on 1000 samples of a beta(1, 10) distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe likelihood argument is not required and will be ignored in this method.\n\n\n\n\nauditPrior(method = \"nonparam\", samples = stats::rbeta(1000, 1, 10))\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution for Audit Sampling\n#> \n#> functional form: Nonparametric \n#> parameters obtained via method 'nonparam'"

    "text": "4.6 Practical Examples\nThis section contains practical examples of how to conduct the planning of statistical audit samples and demonstrates how to set up a prior distribution based on various types of relevant audit information.\n\n4.6.1 Audit Risk Model\nIn our first example, an auditor is performing tests of details on a population of the auditee. For instance, let’s say an auditor is performing an audit on a company’s accounts payable transactions. The company has a total of \\(N\\) = 1000 accounts payable transactions for the year. Rather than testing all 1000 transactions, the auditor can choose to test a sample of the transactions. The performance materiality for the payable transactions account is set to \\(\\theta_{max}\\) = 3%, and the audit risk is set to \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), or 5%. Based on the results of last years audit, where the most likely estimate of the misstatement was 1%, the auditor wants to tolerate 1% misstatements in the sample before giving an unqualified opinion on the population.\n\nar          <- 0.05 # Audit risk\nmateriality <- 0.03 # Performance materiality\nexpected    <- 0.01 # Tolerable deviation rate\n\nBefore tests of details, the auditor has assessed risk of material misstatement via the audit risk model. In this example, the auditor has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls, such as its segregation of duties and its risk management processes, and has determined that they are sufficient to prevent or detect material misstatements. Because the internal control systems were effective, the auditor assesses the control risk as medium. The auditor’s firm defines the risk categories low, medium, and high respectively as 50%, 60%, and 100%. According to the Audit Risk Model, the detection risk can be calculated as a function of the audit risk, the inherent risk and the control risk.\n\nir <- 1              # Inherent risk\ncr <- 0.6            # Control risk\ndr <- ar / (ir * cr) # Detection risk\ndr\n#> [1] 0.08333333\n\nBy using the detection risk of 8.33% as the sampling risk for this population, the auditor can plan for a sample while taking into account the risk-reducing information. The required minimum sample size is 174 in this case.\n\nplanning(materiality = 0.03, expected = expected, conf.level = 1 - dr)\n#> \n#>  Classical Audit Sample Planning\n#> \n#> minimum sample size = 174 \n#> sample size obtained in 175 iterations via method 'poisson'\n\nThe example above is a frequentist one. However, the auditor is free to apply a Bayesian philosophy in planning the sample. For example, the risk assessments from the ARM can be incorporated into a prior distribution. This can be done using method = \"arm\" in the auditPrior() function, which takes the values of the inherent risk probability ir and the control risk probability cr. Hence, the prior distribution in this example can be constructed using the following command:\n\nprior <- auditPrior(method = \"arm\", materiality = 0.03, expected = expected, ir = ir, cr = cr)\n\nThe summary() function can be used to obtain relevant information about the prior distribution.\n\nsummary(prior)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution Summary\n#> \n#> Options:\n#>   Likelihood:                    poisson \n#>   Specifics:                     ir = 1; cr = 0.6; dr = 0.0833333 \n#> \n#> Results:\n#>   Functional form:               gamma(α = 1.46, β = 46) \n#>   Mode:                          0.01 \n#>   Mean:                          0.031739 \n#>   Median:                        0.024859 \n#>   Variance:                      0.00069 \n#>   Skewness:                      1.6552 \n#>   Information entropy (nat):     -2.4894 \n#>   95 percent upper bound:        0.08343 \n#>   Precision:                     0.07343\n\nFurthermore, the prior distribution can be visualized with a call to the plot() function.\n\nplot(prior)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using the prior distribution to incorporate the assessments of the inherent risk and the control risk, the auditor can plan a sample while taking into account the risk-reducing information. The required minimum sample size is also 174 in this case.\n\nplanning(materiality = 0.03, expected = expected, conf.level = 1 - ar, prior = prior)\n#> \n#>  Bayesian Audit Sample Planning\n#> \n#> minimum sample size = 174 \n#> sample size obtained in 175 iterations via method 'poisson' + 'prior'\n\n\n\n4.6.2 Benchmark Analysis\nThe auditor may incorporate information obtained through analytical procedures (Derks et al., 2021), such as a benchmark analysis, into the prior distribution for \\(\\theta\\). While we have previously discussed methods for constructing a prior distribution based on existing knowledge, there is no set procedure for incorporating information obtained through analytical procedures, as these procedures can vary significantly depending on the type of information being incorporated into the prior distribution. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly substantiate the data and assumptions used in this approach and to carefully consider how these assumptions are incorporated into the prior distribution.\nOne way to construct a prior distribution on the basis of data is through the use of regression models, such as benchmarking the relationship between sales and costs of sales within the auditee’s specific industry sector. The jfa package includes a data set benchmark that can be used for this example.\n\ndata(benchmark)\nhead(benchmark)\n#>       sales costofsales\n#> 1 186273256   140755372\n#> 2 336491541   248675452\n#> 3 222693077   164299866\n#> 4 364905221   285768790\n#> 5 382140185   280187371\n#> 6 113666950   101552955\n\nThe auditee’s the sum of the sales is $298,112,312 and the sum of the booked costs of sales is $223,994,405, respectively. This is indicated by a blue dot in the figure below, which visualizes the industry sales versus the cost of sales.\n\nC_real <- 223994405\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between the sales \\(S\\) and the cost of sales \\(C\\) can be modelled by a linear equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  C = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot S + \\epsilon.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn practice, this relationship is often more complex than is presented above, and the auditor must carefully construct and evaluate the applied regression model. However, for ease of understanding we will continue our example with this toy model. The auditor can estimate the regression model using the following command:\n\nfit <- lm(costofsales ~ 1 + sales, data = benchmark)\nsummary(fit)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> lm(formula = costofsales ~ 1 + sales, data = benchmark)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>       Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max \n#> -25736696  -7052141   -226945   6857840  25498106 \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n#> (Intercept) 2.413e+05  3.455e+06    0.07    0.944    \n#> sales       7.366e-01  1.310e-02   56.21   <2e-16 ***\n#> ---\n#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n#> \n#> Residual standard error: 11150000 on 98 degrees of freedom\n#> Multiple R-squared:  0.9699, Adjusted R-squared:  0.9696 \n#> F-statistic:  3160 on 1 and 98 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\nThe predicted cost of sales for the auditee, based on the industry benchmark, can be computed as follows:\n\nC_pred <- predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(sales = 298112312), interval = \"prediction\", level = 0.90)[1]\nC_pred\n#> [1] 219817866\n\nThe fitted regression line and the predicted cost of sales (red dot) are visualized in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prior distribution can be justified by the data and the auditee’s numerical prediction of the cost of sales. In this analytical procedure, the prior distribution on \\(\\theta\\) can utilize the relative error distribution from the linear regression. This relative error distribution, which is a Normal(\\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\)) distribution, captures the uncertainty of the prediction of the cost of sales through the use of linear regression, scaled to be a percentage of the total cost of sales. The mean \\(\\mu\\) of the prior distribution is determined by the relative deviation of the auditee’s booked cost of sales when compared to the predicted cost of sales according to the benchmark data \\(\\frac{C - \\hat{C}}{C}\\).\n\nmu <- (C_real - C_pred) / C_real\nmu\n#> [1] 0.01864573\n\nThe standard deviation of the prior distribution is expressed through the standard deviation of the distribution of \\(\\epsilon\\):\n\nstdev <- sd(fit$residuals) / C_real\nstdev\n#> [1] 0.04951199\n\nThe Normal(0.019, 0.05) prior distribution can be constructed through a call to auditPrior(), where the likelihood of the prior is specified as normal. We call the function with method = \"param\" to manually specify the parameters of the prior distribution.\n\nprior <- auditPrior(method = \"param\", likelihood = \"normal\", alpha = mu, beta = stdev)\nsummary(prior)\n#> \n#>  Prior Distribution Summary\n#> \n#> Options:\n#>   Likelihood:                    normal \n#>   Specifics:                     α = 0.0186457; β = 0.049512 \n#> \n#> Results:\n#>   Functional form:               normal(μ = 0.019, σ = 0.05)T[0,1] \n#>   Mode:                          0.018646 \n#>   Mean:                          0.047096 \n#>   Median:                        0.041335 \n#>   Variance:                      0.0011116 \n#>   Skewness:                      NA \n#>   Information entropy (nat):     -2.1306 \n#>   95 percent upper bound:        0.11012 \n#>   Precision:                     0.091473\n\nThe specified prior distribution can be visualized using the plot() function.\n\nplot(prior)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe performance materiality for this example is set to \\(\\theta_{max}\\) = 5%, and the audit risk is set to \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), or 5%. By using this prior distribution, the required minimum sample size is 50.\n\nplan <- planning(materiality = 0.05, conf.level = 0.95, likelihood = \"binomial\", prior = prior)\nplan\n#> \n#>  Bayesian Audit Sample Planning\n#> \n#> minimum sample size = 50 \n#> sample size obtained in 51 iterations via method 'binomial' + 'prior'\n\nYou can inspect how the prior distribution compares to the expected posterior distribution by using the plot() function.\n\nplot(plan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using a frequentist approach, the required minimum sample size is 50. Thus, by performing the analytical procedure and incorporating this information into the prior distribution, the auditor has achieved a reduction in sample size of 9 items.\n\nplan <- planning(materiality = 0.05, conf.level = 0.95, likelihood = \"binomial\")\nplan\n#> \n#>  Classical Audit Sample Planning\n#> \n#> minimum sample size = 59 \n#> sample size obtained in 60 iterations via method 'binomial'\n\n\n\n4.6.3 Predictive Modeling\nAs a final example, we consider an example wehre the auditor incorporates information about the probability of misstatement obtained through a predictive analysis into the prior distribution for \\(\\theta\\). In this example, the auditor is conducting an audit on a long-term client that they have been working with for fifteen years. Hence, the auditor has access to a historycal data set called history, which contains the samples from all of the previous audits that have been conducted on this auditee over the past fifteen years.\n\nhistory <- read.csv(\"https://github.com/koenderks/sasr/raw/master/data/ch3_history.csv\", colClasses = c(\"factor\", \"numeric\", \"numeric\"))\nhead(history)\n#>   k  ftes days\n#> 1 0  2.09 1.83\n#> 2 0 17.51 5.02\n#> 3 0 17.29 8.47\n#> 4 0 23.88 8.31\n#> 5 0 15.31 8.25\n#> 6 0 18.28 4.47\n\nIt should be noted that for all historical sample items, there are three known characteristics: whether they contained a misstatement (designated as k), the number of full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) who had access to that item within the internal computer systems of the auditee (designated as ftes), and the number of days that the item was outstanding (designated as days). Additionally, the ftes and days characteristics are also known for all items in the current year’s population. Of course, it is unknown if any misstatements exist within the population of the current year.\n\npopulation <- read.csv(\"https://github.com/koenderks/sasr/raw/master/data/ch3_population.csv\")\nhead(population)\n#>      ID bookValue ftes days\n#> 1 82884    242.61   14    4\n#> 2 25064    642.99   11    4\n#> 3 81235    628.53    8    3\n#> 4 71769    431.87   11    3\n#> 5 55080    620.88   12    3\n#> 6 93224    501.76   12    5\n\nThe objective of this analytical procedure is to forecast potential misstatements within the population of the current year. In order for the information obtained through this procedure to serve as prior knowledge in a Bayesian analysis, the procedure must yield a distribution of the probability of misstatement. Therefore, the auditor employs a machine learning technique known as Random Forest (Hastie et al., 2009) to learn the relationship between misstatements, the number of full-time equivalent employees, and the number of outstanding days in the historical data set.\n\nset.seed(1)\nfit <- randomForest::randomForest(formula = k ~ ftes + days, data = history)\n\nThe auditor specifically uses the random forest technique due to its ability to provide a distribution of the misstatement probabilities. The probabilistic predictions for the unseen misstatements in the population data can be obtained by calling the predict() function with the argument type = \"prob\".\n\npredictions <- predict(object = fit, newdata = population, type = \"prob\")\n\nThese predictions come in a probabilistic format, which means that for each item in the population of the current year there is a predicted probability that that item is misstated. These probabilities are stored in the second column of the predictions data frame.\n\nhead(predictions)\n#>       0     1\n#> 1 0.974 0.026\n#> 2 0.966 0.034\n#> 3 0.992 0.008\n#> 4 0.928 0.072\n#> 5 0.776 0.224\n#> 6 0.982 0.018\n\nThe prior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) will be based on the distribution of probabilities that each item in the population is misstated. In contrast to the previous example, this distribution is not a parametric distribution, which means we are unable to utilize any parametric priors from jfa. However, by providing samples of the prior distribution, jfa is able to construct a nonparametric prior distribution internally via the density of the samples.\nThe nonparametric prior distribution can be constructed through a call to auditPrior(), where the method to construct of the prior is specified as nonparam.

    "text": "5.1 Sampling Units\nSelecting a subset from the population requires knowledge of the sampling units; physical representations of the population that needs to be audited. Generally, the auditor has to choose between two types of sampling units: individual items in the population or individual monetary units in the population. In order to perform statistical selection, the population must be divided into individual sampling units that can be assigned a probability to be included in the sample. The total collection of all sampling units which have been assigned a selection probability is called the sampling frame.\n\n5.1.1 Items\nA sampling unit for record (i.e., attributes) sampling is generally a characteristic of an item in the population. For example, suppose that you inspect a population of receipts. A possible sampling unit for record sampling can be the date of payment of the receipt. When a sampling unit (e.g., date of payment) is selected by the sampling method, the population item that corresponds to the sampled unit is included in the sample.\n\n\n5.1.2 Monetary Units\nA sampling unit for monetary unit sampling is different than a sampling unit for record sampling in that it is an individual monetary unit within an item or transaction, like an individual dollar. For example, a single sampling unit can be the 10\\(^{th}\\) dollar from a specific receipt in the population. When a sampling unit (e.g., individual dollar) is selected by the sampling method, the population item that includes the sampling unit is included in the sample."

    "text": "5.2 Sampling Methods\nThis section discusses four sampling methods that are commonly used in audit sampling. The methods that will be discussed are:\n\nRandom sampling\nFixed interval sampling\nCell sampling\nModified sieve sampling\n\nFirst, let’s get some notation out of the way. As discussed in Chapter 2, the population size \\(N\\) is defined as the total set of individual sampling units (denoted by \\(x_i\\)).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  N = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N\\}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn statistical sampling, every sampling unit \\(x_i\\) in the population should receive a selection probability \\(p(x_i)\\). The purpose of the sampling method is to provide a framework to assign selection probabilities to each of the sampling units, and subsequently draw sampling units from the population until a set of size \\(n\\) has been created.\nTo illustrate how the resulting sample differs for various sampling methods, we will use the BuildIt data set included in the jfa package. These data can be loaded into R using the code below. For simplicity, we will use a sample size of \\(n = 10\\) for all examples.\n\ndata(BuildIt)\nn <- 10\n\n\n5.2.1 Random Sampling\nRandom sampling is the most simple and straight-forward selection method. The random sampling method provides a method that allows every sampling unit in the population an equal chance of being selected, meaning that every combination of sampling units has the same probability of being selected as every other combination of the same number of sampling units. Simply put, the algorithm draws a random selection of size \\(n\\) of the sampling units. Therefore, the selection probability for each sampling unit is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  p(x) = \\frac{1}{N}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTo make this procedure visually intuitive, the figure below provides an illustration of the random sampling method.\n\n\n\nIllustration of random sampling\n\n\n\nAdvantage(s): The random sampling method yields an optimal random selection, with the additional advantage that the sample can be easily extended by applying the same method again.\nDisadvantages: Because the selection probabilities are equal for all sampling units there is no guarantee that items with a large monetary value in the population will be included in the sample.\n\n\n5.2.1.1 Record Sampling\nRandom sampling can easily be coded in base R. First, we have to get a vector of of the possible items (rows) in the population that can be selected. When we are performing record sampling, we can simply use R’s build in sample() function to draw a random sample from a vector 1:nrow(BuildIt) representing the row indices of the items and store the result in a variable items.\n\nset.seed(1)\nitems <- sample(1:nrow(BuildIt), size = n, replace = FALSE)\nitems\n#>  [1] 1017  679 2177  930 1533  471 2347  270 1211 3379\n\nYou can then select the sample from the population using the selected indices stored in items.\n\nBuildIt[items, ]\n#>         ID bookValue auditValue\n#> 1017 50755    618.24     618.24\n#> 679  20237    669.75     669.75\n#> 2177  9517    454.02     454.02\n#> 930  85674    257.82     257.82\n#> 1533 31051    308.53     308.53\n#> 471  84375    824.66     824.66\n#> 2347 75616    623.70     623.70\n#> 270  82033    352.75     352.75\n#> 1211 12877     52.89      52.89\n#> 3379 85322    330.24     330.24\n\nThe sample can be reproduced in jfa via the selection() function. This function takes as input the population data, the sample size, and the characteristics of the sampling method. The argument units allows you to specify that you want to use record sampling (units = \"items\"), while the method argument enables you to specify that you are performing random sampling (method = 'random').\n\nset.seed(1)\nresult <- selection(data = BuildIt, size = n, units = \"items\", method = \"random\")\nresult$sample\n#>     row times    ID bookValue auditValue\n#> 1  1017     1 50755    618.24     618.24\n#> 2   679     1 20237    669.75     669.75\n#> 3  2177     1  9517    454.02     454.02\n#> 4   930     1 85674    257.82     257.82\n#> 5  1533     1 31051    308.53     308.53\n#> 6   471     1 84375    824.66     824.66\n#> 7  2347     1 75616    623.70     623.70\n#> 8   270     1 82033    352.75     352.75\n#> 9  1211     1 12877     52.89      52.89\n#> 10 3379     1 85322    330.24     330.24\n\nAn alternative to specifying the desired sample size through the size argument is to provide an object generated by the planning() function to the selection() function. For instance, the following code utilizes the planning() function to plan a sample size based on a performance materiality of 3% and a sampling risk of 5%, which can be passed directly to selection() to select the sample from the BuildIt population.\n\nplan <- planning(materiality = 0.03)\nresult <- selection(data = BuildIt, size = plan, units = \"items\", method = \"random\")\n\nThe ability of one function to accept input from another function allows for the implementation of a workflow in which the planning() function and the selection() function are sequentially linked. Additionally, the use of R’s native pipe operator |> further simplifies this process.\n\nresult <- planning(materiality = 0.03) |>\n            selection(data = BuildIt, units = \"items\", method = \"random\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional arguments to selection()\n\n\n\nThe selection() function has three additional arguments which you can use to preprocess your population before selection. These arguments are order, decreasing and randomize.\nThe order argument takes as input a column name in data which determines the order of the population. For example, you can order the population from lowest book value to highest book value before engaging in the selection. In this case, you should use the decreasing = FALSE (its default value) argument.\n\nset.seed(1)\nresult <- selection(data = BuildIt, size = n, units = \"items\", method = \"random\", order = \"bookValue\")\nresult$sample\n#>     row times    ID bookValue auditValue\n#> 1    29     1 58849    274.26     274.26\n#> 2  3297     1 24279    229.95     229.95\n#> 3   931     1 28025    429.14     429.14\n#> 4   756     1 11563    263.08     105.23\n#> 5  3375     1 58981    335.39     335.39\n#> 6  1624     1 97783    197.19     197.19\n#> 7  2534     1 95715    457.42     457.42\n#> 8  1798     1 95520    157.54     157.54\n#> 9  3448     1 12959    296.82     296.82\n#> 10  450     1 39908    831.31     831.31\n\nThe randomize argument can be used to randomly shuffle the items in the population before selection. For example, you can randomly shuffle the population before engaging in the selection using randomize = TRUE.\n\nset.seed(1)\nresult <- selection(data = BuildIt, size = n, units = \"items\", method = \"random\", randomize = TRUE)\nresult$sample\n#>     row times    ID bookValue auditValue\n#> 1  1264     1 85424    406.81     406.81\n#> 2   923     1 12566    287.61     287.61\n#> 3   776     1 92923    247.89     247.89\n#> 4   127     1 71325    306.78     306.78\n#> 5  1611     1 10019    191.18     191.18\n#> 6  3087     1 87887    666.13     666.13\n#> 7  1729     1 78779    608.02     608.02\n#> 8  2037     1 74155    347.18     347.18\n#> 9  2769     1 26010    240.10     240.10\n#> 10 2276     1 80154    282.91     282.91\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1.2 Monetary Unit Sampling\nWhen we are performing record sampling, we have to consider that each item in the population consists of multiple smaller items (i.e., the monetary units), which means that items with a higher book value should get a higher probability of being selected. The sample() function faciliates weighted selection via the prob argument, which takes a vector of values and, using normalization, computes the weights for selection. The call below is similar to before, but in this case we use the book values in the column bookValues of the data set to weigh the items and store the result in a variable items.\n\nset.seed(1)\nitems <- sample(1:nrow(BuildIt), size = n, replace = FALSE, prob = BuildIt$bookValue)\nitems\n#>  [1] 2174 2928 1627  700  147 3056 3118 2045 1311  716\n\nYou can then select the sample from the population using the selected indices stored in items.\n\nBuildIt[items, ]\n#>         ID bookValue auditValue\n#> 2174 90260    625.98     625.98\n#> 2928 68595    548.21     548.21\n#> 1627 98301    429.07     429.07\n#> 700  29683    239.26     239.26\n#> 147  72906    677.62     677.62\n#> 3056 86317    246.22     246.22\n#> 3118 14548    204.63     204.63\n#> 2045 45416    381.05     381.05\n#> 1311 91955    398.96     398.96\n#> 716  12815    873.43     873.43\n\nThe sample can be reproduced in jfa via the selection() function. The argument units allows you to specify that you want to use monetary unit sampling (units = \"values\"), while the method argument enables you to specify that you are performing random sampling (method = 'random'). Note that you should provide the name of the column in the data that contains the monetary units via the values argument.\n\nset.seed(1)\nresult <- selection(data = BuildIt, size = n, units = \"values\", method = \"random\", values = \"bookValue\")\nresult$sample\n#>     row times    ID bookValue auditValue\n#> 1  2174     1 90260    625.98     625.98\n#> 2  2928     1 68595    548.21     548.21\n#> 3  1627     1 98301    429.07     429.07\n#> 4   700     1 29683    239.26     239.26\n#> 5   147     1 72906    677.62     677.62\n#> 6  3056     1 86317    246.22     246.22\n#> 7  3118     1 14548    204.63     204.63\n#> 8  2045     1 45416    381.05     381.05\n#> 9  1311     1 91955    398.96     398.96\n#> 10  716     1 12815    873.43     873.43\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Fixed Interval Sampling\nFixed interval sampling is a method designed for yielding representative samples from monetary populations. The algorithm determines a uniform interval on the (optionally ranked) sampling units. Next, a starting point is handpicked or randomly selected in the first interval and a sampling unit is selected throughout the population at each of the uniform intervals from the starting point. For example, if the interval has a width of 10 sampling units and sampling unit number 5 is chosen as the starting point, the sampling units 5, 15, 25, etc. are selected to be included in the sample.\nThe number of required intervals \\(I\\) can be determined by dividing the number of sampling units in the population by the required sample size:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  I = \\frac{N}{n},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nin which \\(n\\) is the required sample size and \\(N\\) is the total number of sampling units in the population.\nIf the space between the selected sampling units is equal, the selection probability for each sampling unit is theoretically defined as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  p(x) = \\frac{1}{I},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwith the property that the space between selected units \\(i\\) is the same as the interval \\(I\\), see the figure below. However, in practice the selection is deterministic and completely depends on the chosen starting points (using start).\n\n\n\nIllustration of fixed interval sampling\n\n\nThe fixed interval method yields a sample that allows every sampling unit in the population an equal chance of being selected. However, the fixed interval method has the property that all items in the population with a monetary value larger than the interval \\(I\\) have an selection probability of one because one of these items’ sampling units are always selected from the interval. Note that, if the population is arranged randomly with respect to its deviation pattern, fixed interval sampling is equivalent to random selection.\n\nAdvantage(s): The advantage of the fixed interval sampling method is that it is often simple to understand and fast to perform. Another advantage is that, in monetary unit sampling, all items that are greater than the calculated interval will be included in the sample. In record sampling, since units can be ranked on the basis of value, there is also a guarantee that some large items will be in the sample.\nDisadvantage(s): A pattern in the population can coincide with the selected interval, rendering the sample less representative. What is sometimes seen as an added complication for this method is that the sample is hard to extend after drawing the initial sample. This is due to the chance of selecting the same sampling unit. However, by removing the already selected sampling units from the population and redrawing the intervals this problem can be efficiently solved.\n\n\n5.2.2.1 Record Sampling\nTo code fixed interval sampling in a record sampling context, we first have to compute the size of the interval we are working with. This is computed by dividing the number of items in the population by the desired sample size \\(n\\). Suppose the auditor wants to select a sample of 10 items, then the interval is computed by:\n\ninterval <- nrow(BuildIt) / n\n\nNext, we have to determine the starting point.

Within each interval, a sampling unit is selected by randomly drawing a number between 1 and the interval range \\(I\\). This causes the space \\(i\\) between the sampling units to vary.\nLike in the fixed interval sampling method, the selection probability for each sampling unit is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  p(x) = \\frac{1}{I}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\nIllustration of cell sampling\n\n\nThe cell sampling method has the property that all items in the population with a monetary value larger than twice the interval \\(I\\) have a selection probability of one.\n\nAdvantage(s): More sets of samples are possible than in fixed interval sampling, as there is no systematic interval \\(i\\) to determine the selections. It is argued that the cell sampling algorithm offers a solution to the pattern problem in fixed interval sampling.\nDisadvantage(s): A disadvantage of this sampling method is that not all items in the population with a monetary value larger than the interval have a selection probability of one. Besides, population items can be in two adjacent cells, thereby creating the possibility that an items is included in the sample twice.\n\n\n5.2.3.1 Record Sampling\nTo code cell sampling in a record sampling context, we again have to compute the size of the interval we are working with:\n\ninterval <- nrow(BuildIt) / n\n\nNext, we have to randomly determine which items are going to be selected in each interval.\n\nset.seed(1)\nstarts <- floor(runif(n, 0, interval))\n\nTo find which rows are part of the sample, we execute the following code:\n\nitems <- floor(starts + interval * 0:(n - 1))\n\nYou can then select the sample from the population using the selected indices stored in items.\n\nBuildIt[items, ]\n#>         ID bookValue auditValue\n#> 92   75133    355.16     355.16\n#> 480  81037    456.27     456.27\n#> 900   1730    449.87     449.87\n#> 1367 36587    282.32     282.32\n#> 1470 10305    648.70     648.70\n#> 2064 96344    268.94     268.94\n#> 2430 60885    493.77     493.77\n#> 2681 60935    312.98     312.98\n#> 3020  8716    450.76     450.76\n#> 3171 61036    387.67     387.67\n\nThe sample can be reproduced in jfa via the selection() function.

The algorithm starts by selecting a standard uniform random number \\(R_i\\) between 0 and 1 for each item in the population. Next, the sieve ratio:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  S_i = \\frac{Y_i}{R_i}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nis computed for each item by dividing the book value of that item by the random number. Lastly, the items in the population are sorted by their sieve ratio \\(S\\) (in decreasing order) and the top \\(n\\) items are selected for inspection. In contrast to the classical sieve sampling method (Rietveld, 1978), the modified sieve sampling method provides precise control over sample sizes.\n\n5.2.4.1 Monetary Unit Sampling\n\nset.seed(1)\nall_units <- ifelse(BuildIt$bookValue < 0, 0, BuildIt$bookValue)\nall_items <- 1:nrow(BuildIt)\nri <- all_units / stats::runif(length(all_items), 0, 1)\nitems <- all_items[order(-ri)]\nitems <- items[1:n]\n\nYou can then select the sample from the population using the selected indices stored in items.\n\nBuildIt[items, ]\n#>         ID bookValue auditValue\n#> 2329 29919    681.10     681.10\n#> 2883 59402    279.29     279.29\n#> 1949 56012    581.22     581.22\n#> 3065 47482    621.73     621.73\n#> 1072 79901    789.97     789.97\n#> 488  50811    651.35     651.35\n#> 1916 53565    266.37     266.37\n#> 463  65768    480.89     480.89\n#> 1311 91955    398.96     398.96\n#> 2895  8688    492.02     492.02\n\nThe sample can be reproduced in jfa via the selection() function.

The call below evaluates the sample using a Bayesian non-stratified evaluation procedure.\n\nprior <- auditPrior(materiality = 0.05, method = \"default\", likelihood = \"binomial\")\nevaluation(materiality = 0.05, x = 1, n = 100, prior = prior)\n#> \n#>  Bayesian Audit Sample Evaluation\n#> \n#> data:  1 and 100\n#> number of errors = 1, number of samples = 100, taint = 1, BF₁₀ =\n#> 515.86\n#> alternative hypothesis: true misstatement rate is less than 0.05\n#> 95 percent credible interval:\n#>  0.00000000 0.04610735\n#> most likely estimate:\n#>  0.01 \n#> results obtained via method 'binomial' + 'prior'\n\nThe output shows that the most likely error in the population is estimated to be 1 / 100 = 1% and that the 95% (one-sided) credible interval ranges from 0% to 4.61%. The small difference between the classical and default Bayesian results is due to the prior distribution, which must be proper in order to calculate a Bayes factor (classical results can be emulated by constructing a prior with method = \"strict\" in the auditPrior() function). The Bayes factor in this case is shown to be \\(BF_{10}=515\\), meaning that the data from the sample are about 515 times more likely to occur under the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement than under the hypothesis of material misstatement.\nThe prior distribution and posterior distribution can be used to directly calculate the Bayes factor in favor of (in)tolerable misstatement. To begin, we compute the prior probability of the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement.\n\nprior.prob.h1 <- pbeta(0.05, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 1)\nprior.prob.h1\n#> [1] 0.05\n\nSince the hypothesis of intolerable misstatement is the complement of the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement, its probabilitiy is simply one minus the prior probability of the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement.\n\nprior.prob.h0 <- 1 - prior.prob.h1\nprior.prob.h0\n#> [1] 0.95\n\nThe prior odds is the ratio of the prior probabilities.\n\nprior.odds.h1 <- prior.prob.h1 / prior.prob.h0\nprior.odds.h1\n#> [1] 0.05263158\n\nNext, the posterior probability of the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement can be computed using the posterior distribution.\n\npost.prob.h1 <- pbeta(0.05, shape1 = 1 + 1, shape2 = 1 + 100 - 1)\npost.prob.h1\n#> [1] 0.9644768\n\nThe posterior probabilitiy of the hypothesis of intolerable misstatement is one minus the posterior probability of the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement.\n\npost.prob.h0 <- 1 - post.prob.h1\npost.prob.h0\n#> [1] 0.03552318\n\nThe posterior odds is the ratio of the posterior probabilities.\n\npost.odds.h1 <- post.prob.h1 / post.prob.h0\npost.odds.h1\n#> [1] 27.15064\n\nThe Bayes factor is the ratio of posterior odds and prior odds and equals 515.86.\n\nbf10 <- post.odds.h1 / prior.odds.h1\nbf10\n#> [1] 515.8621\n\nNote that this is a very high Bayes factor for the little data that is observed. That is because the Bayes factor is dependent on the prior distribution for the model parameters (in this case \\(\\theta\\)). As a rule of thumb, when the prior distribution is highly conservative (as with method = 'default') with respect to the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement, the Bayes factor tends to over quantify the evidence in favor of this hypothesis. You can mitigate this dependency by using a prior distribution that is impartial with respect to the hypotheses via method = \"impartial\" in the auditPrior() function (Derks et al., 2022).\n\nprior <- auditPrior(materiality = 0.05, method = \"impartial\", likelihood = \"binomial\")\nevaluation(materiality = 0.05, x = 1, n = 100, prior = prior)\n#> \n#>  Bayesian Audit Sample Evaluation\n#> \n#> data:  1 and 100\n#> number of errors = 1, number of samples = 100, taint = 1, BF₁₀ =\n#> 47.435\n#> alternative hypothesis: true misstatement rate is less than 0.05\n#> 95 percent credible interval:\n#>  0.00000000 0.04110834\n#> most likely estimate:\n#>  0.0088878 \n#> results obtained via method 'binomial' + 'prior'\n\nThe output shows that \\(BF_{10}=47\\), implying that under the assumption of impartiality there is strong evidence for \\(H_1\\), the hypothesis that the population contains misstatements lower than 5 percent of the population (tolerable misstatement). Since the two prior distributions both resulted in convincing Bayes factors, the results can be considered robust to the choice of prior distribution. Hence, the auditor is able to conclude that the sample provides convincing evidence to state that the population does not contain material misstatement."

    "text": "8.3 Evaluation\nFinally, evaluating a sample in JASP for Audit works similar to how you would do it in jfa. The figure below showcases a snapshot of the evaluation analysis in JASP for Audit. In the user interface, the auditor can input the known parameters for the sample evaluation, after which JASP calculates and directly displays the statistical results.\n\n\n\nA snapshot of the classical evaluation analysis in JASP for Audit. In this analysis, the auditor is using the binomial likelihood, a sampling risk of 5%, a performance materiality of 6% and evaluates a sample of 50 items of which 0 contained a misstatement. The resulting upper bound is 5.8% and the p-value is 0.045.\n\n\nThe above screenshot shows an analysis where the auditor is using the binomial likelihood, a sampling risk of 5%, a performance materiality of 6% and evaluates a sample of \\(n = 50\\) items of which \\(k = 0\\) contained a misstatement. The resulting 95% upper confidence bound is 5.8% and the p-value is 0.045, which is lower than the sampling risk of 5%.\nUsing jfa, these statistical results can be reproduced by executing the following code:\n\nevaluation(materiality = 0.06, method = \"binomial\", x = 0, n = 50)\n#> \n#>  Classical Audit Sample Evaluation\n#> \n#> data:  0 and 50\n#> number of errors = 0, number of samples = 50, taint = 0, p-value =\n#> 0.045331\n#> alternative hypothesis: true misstatement rate is less than 0.06\n#> 95 percent confidence interval:\n#>  0.00000000 0.05815508\n#> most likely estimate:\n#>  0 \n#> results obtained via method 'binomial'\n\nThe figure below showcases a snapshot of the Bayesian evaluation analysis in JASP. The graphical user interface is fairly similar to that of the classical evaluation analysis, with the exception that we can specify a prior distribution with the options under “Prior”.\n\n\n\nSnapshot of the Bayesian evaluation analysis in JASP for Audit. In this analysis, the auditor is using the binomial likelihood together with a beta prior distribution, a sampling risk of 5%, a performance materiality of 3% and evaluates a sample of 120 items of which 1 contained a misstatement. The resulting upper bound is 3.27% and the Bayes factor in favor of tolerable misstatement is 9.394.\n\n\nThe above screenshot shows an analysis where the auditor is using the binomial likelihood together with a beta prior distribution based on an expected error rate of 3% constructed using the audit risk model, a sampling risk of 5%, a performance materiality of 3% and evaluates a sample of \\(n = 120\\) items of which \\(k = 1\\) contained a misstatement. The resulting 95% upper credible bound is 3.27% and the Bayes factor in favor of tolerable misstatement is 9.394, indicating that the sample data are about 9 times more likely to occur under the hypothesis of tolerable misstatement than under the hypothesis of intolerable misstatement.\nUsing jfa, these statistical results can be reproduced by executing the following code:\n\nprior <- auditPrior(method = \"arm\", likelihood = \"binomial\", materiality = 0.03, expected = 0.01, ir = 0.6, cr = 1)\nevaluation(materiality = 0.03, method = \"binomial\", x = 1, n = 120, prior = prior)\n#> \n#>  Bayesian Audit Sample Evaluation\n#> \n#> data:  1 and 120\n#> number of errors = 1, number of samples = 120, taint = 1, BF₁₀ =\n#> 9.3941\n#> alternative hypothesis: true misstatement rate is less than 0.03\n#> 95 percent credible interval:\n#>  0.00000000 0.03267759\n#> most likely estimate:\n#>  0.0088415 \n#> results obtained via method 'binomial' + 'prior'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerks, K., Swart, J. de, Wagenmakers, E., Wille, J., & Wetzels, R.

    "title": "R Tutorial",
    "section": "Calculations",
    "text": "Calculations\nOne of the basic features of R is its ability to perform calculations. In R, basic calculations work by using the standard arithmetic operators such as + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division. For example, if you want to calculate 2 + 3, you would type in 2 + 3 and R will return the result of 5.\n\n2 + 3\n#> [1] 5\n\nR also allows for more advanced calculations such as exponentiation using the ^ operator, and square roots using the sqrt() function. For example, to calculate the square root of 9, you would type in sqrt(9) and R will return the result of 3.\n\nsqrt(9)\n#> [1] 3\n\nYou can also use parentheses to specify the order of operations in your calculations. For example, if you want to calculate (2 + 3) * 4, you would type in (2 + 3) * 4 to get the result of 20.\n\n(2 + 3) * 4\n#> [1] 20\n\nOverall, basic calculations in R are similar to those in other programming languages and follow the standard order of operations.\n\nVectors\nIn R, vectors are one-dimensional arrays of data that can hold numeric, character, or logical values. Vectors can be created using the c() function, which stands for concatenate. For example, to create a numeric vector, you can use the following code:\n\nx <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nTo create a character vector, you can use quotes around the values:\n\ny <- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\")\n\nTo create a logical vector, you can use the logical values TRUE and FALSE:\n\nz <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)\n\nVectors can be indexed using square brackets and a numeric value. For example, to access the second element of the vector x, you can use the following code:\n\nx[2]\n#> [1] 2\n\nVectors can also be subsetted using a logical vector. For example, to get all elements of the vector x that are greater than 3, you can use the following code:\n\nx[x > 3]\n#> [1] 4 5\n\nVectors can also be modified using indexing and assignment. For example, to change the third element of the vector x to 6, you can use the following code:\n\nx[3]\n#> [1] 3\nx[3] <- 6\nx[3]\n#> [1] 6\n\nR has many built-in functions for performing mathematical operations on vectors. For example, you can use the mean() function to calculate the average of a vector of numbers, or we can use the length() function to calculate the number of elements in a vector:\n\nmean(x)\n#> [1] 3.6\nlength(y)\n#> [1] 3\n\nOverall, vectors are a useful data structure in R for storing and manipulating data.\n\n\nMatrices\nIn R, a matrix is a two-dimensional collection of values that are arranged in rows and columns. You can create a matrix using the matrix() function. For example:\n\nm <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)\nm\n#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]\n#> [1,]    1    4    7\n#> [2,]    2    5    8\n#> [3,]    3    6    9\n\nThis creates a 3x3 matrix with the values 1, 2, 3 in the first column, 4, 5, 6 in the second column, and 7, 8, 9 in the third column.\nYou can also create a matrix by combining several vectors using the cbind() or rbind() functions. For example:\n\nv1 <- c(1, 2, 3)\nv2 <- c(4, 5, 6)\nv3 <- c(7, 8, 9)\nm <- cbind(v1, v2, v3)\nm\n#>      v1 v2 v3\n#> [1,]  1  4  7\n#> [2,]  2  5  8\n#> [3,]  3  6  9\n\nThis creates a matrix with the same values as before, but the columns are created by binding the vectors together.\nYou can access the elements of a matrix using the square bracket notation. For example, to access the element in the second row and third column of m, you would use the following code:\n\nm[2, 3]\n#> v3 \n#>  8\n\nYou can also use the dim() function to get the dimensions of a matrix, and the colnames() and rownames() functions to get the names of the columns and rows, respectively.\nThere are many other functions and operations available for working with matrices in R, including mathematical operations such as matrix multiplication and inversion.\n\n\nData Frames\nIn R, a data frame is a two-dimensional table of data with rows and columns. Each row represents a single observation or record, and each column represents a particular variable or attribute. Data frames are similar to a spreadsheet in Excel or a table in a database. Each column in a data frame can have a different data type, such as numerical, character, or logical. The data in each row must match the data type of the corresponding column.\nTo create a data frame in R, you can use the data.frame() function and pass in the data you want to include in the data frame as arguments. For example:\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(4, 5, 6))\n\nThis will create a data frame with two columns, x and y, and three rows of data. You can access the data in a data frame using indexing and subsetting. For example, to access the first row of the data frame, you can use the following command:\n\ndf[1, ]\n#>   x y\n#> 1 1 4\n\nTo access a specific column, you can use the $ operator (or the index):\n\ndf$x\n#> [1] 1 2 3\ndf[, 1]\n#> [1] 1 2 3\n\nYou can also use functions like head() and tail() to view the first or last few rows of a data frame. Data frames also have several built-in functions that allow you to manipulate and analyze the data. For example, you can use the summarize() function to calculate summary statistics for each column, or the group_by() function to group the data by a specific variable and apply a function to each group."

How this is done depends on the type of data file that you want to read.\n\nBuilt-in Data\nData that is included in an R package can be loaded via the data() function. For example, to load the BuildIt data set that is included in the jfa package, you can run the following R code. Note that this requires that the package is loaded in the R session via a call to library().\n\ndata(BuildIt)\n\n\n\nLoading Data from a CSV File\nA commonly used data type is a .csv file. You can load this type of files via the read.csv() function. For example, if the file example.csv is in the current working directory, you can load it by running:\n\nread.csv(\"example.csv\")\n\n\n\nLoading Data from an Excel File\nAnother commonly used data type are Excel files. You can load this type of files via the read_excel() function from the readxl package. For this to work, you should first install this package using the install.packages() command and load it into the R session using a call to library(). For example, if the file example.xlsx is in the current working directory, and the data you want to load is on the first worksheet, you can load it by running:\n\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\")\nlibrary(readxl)\nread_excel(\"example.csv\", sheet = 1)"
